Chancellor Angela Merkel will not personally attend a meeting in the U.S. with the leaders of the world’s major economies if President Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said Saturday.
After canceling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10-12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic.
“I don’t condone them,” he said.
“But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.”
Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force.
The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000.
He said that if the violence was not brought under control, the National Guard would do the job.
The president's Democratic Party rival, Joe Biden, has accused him of giving oxygen to bigotry and said those responsible for Mr Floyd's death must be held accountable.
But he also condemned rioting, saying: "Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."
What happened to George Floyd?
On Monday night, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit 20$ note.
Officers responded and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic.
According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed.
Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.
