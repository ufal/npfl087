This is fully o ver lo a ded.
Okay.
If yo u can hear me that's o kay.
So let me wel co me yo u.
At the first ses si on of the spring term of se minar, or mon day se minar.
And it is my ple a sure to wel co me he re, o ne of o ur col le a gu es.
At UFAL.
And I 'm re ally e a ger to know what well what e ver ything can go wrong in live spe ech tran sla ti on.
So the flo or.
Is yo ur's.
Thank yo u for the in tro duc ti on.
Well, I 'm af ra id that yo u will in de ed se e it li ve.
So as an no un ced this is a sum mary of the cur rent sta tus of the ELITR pro ject whe re we a re trying to do live sub tit ling into many tar get lan gu a ges, and I will bri efly des cri be how that works.
I'll give it o ne more try.
If the re is an ything ap pe a ring, no it does not seem so.
Oh, yes, the re is. So met hing is hap pe ning!
So it is may be may be at the bot tom of the scre en.
The re will be English sub tit les of what I 'm say ing, it is to tally not cer ta in. The re can be many flaws in tho se in tho se tran scripts and de libe rately were a re not sho wing the tran sla ti on, be ca u se the tran sla ti on has a hard time in fit ting into the se two li nes.
But if yo u have a, but if yo u have to your mac hi nes, your no tebo oks, or or may be even cell pho nes with yo u.
The re is a sha red Go og le do cument, which yo u pro bably know from pre vi ous Mon day Se minars, and the re is two links whe re yo u can se e also the tran sla ti ons, not only in the tran scripts, and yo u can cho o se the tar get lan gu a ges.
I be li e ve Hin di, is also a mong also a mong the tar get lan gu a ges.
So the re will be some in ten ti o nal jo kes du ring the pre sen ta ti on, and the re will be many u nin ten ti o nal ones in the sub tit les.
Ple a se do not la ugh to o lo ud.
We we know what is ap pe a ring the re.
But that is that is life that is work in prog ress.
So to day.
I wo uld like to bri efly dis cuss the dif fe ren ces bet we en mac hi ne tran sla ti on and spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on.
And then I'll sum ma rize the am bi ti on that o ur pro ject has ah, and, be ca u se the am bi ti on is is high.
We know it.
We run a num ber of test ses si ons.
And this is ac tu ally o ne of the test ses si ons as well.
So af ter the sum mary of the test ses si ons that that we a re ta king part in.
I will bri efly sum ma rize the old ar chi tec tu re.
And then I will go a long all the pos sib le is su es of all the e ver ything that can go wrong.
That's yeah that is a long long list of things that that can go wrong.
And luck ily, thanks to the num ber of e vents that we a re trying this list of er rors.
Is well the er rors that we spot on.
Every new se minar in stan ce, is is not gro wing much.
So we still have the er rors.
But luck ily, we a re clo se to se eing known er rors, which we have some ways, at le ast, in some ca ses, we which we have some ways to fix. Okay, and then I will sum ma rize and call to ac ti on.
So a ga in, tiny url dot com.
ELITR mon day tests.
That is whe re yo u can se e the sub tit les.
Okay, ah, we have been wor king.
We as the De par tment have been wor king on mac hi ne tran sla ti on, for many ye ars, or de cades ac tu ally and.
When yo u say mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
We might mean text tran sla ti on.
And the re the im put a re sen ten ces, which a re, which a re al most al ways gram ma tically, cor rect, and they may come in do cuments.
So yo u may have some con tent, some con text sur ro un ding the sen ten ces, or yo u might tran sla te sen ten ce by sen ten ce.
But it is de fini tely like sen ten ce ba sed. In spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on.
The in put is so und.
And the o ut put is text.
We will get to some more de ta ils a bo ut.
What does this text, but sen ten ces, may or may not be pro duced, and ac tu ally they so meti mes sho uld not be as su med at all.
So may be what we all know that we do not spe ak in sen ten ces and fi guring o ut whe re the sen ten ce.
End is is a dif fi cult part.
So that is the re.
The re will be some ten si on.
When when put ting the se two com po nents to get her, the spe ech re cog ni ti on and the mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
And the re is o ne more area that I wo uld like to just men ti on is cal led "in cre men tal mac hi ne tran sla ti on".
And the re, this is mac hi ne tran sla ti on, re se ar chers do ing that.
So they start with words, words that come in sen ten ces, and they just feed the system with the words, but o ne at ti me.
So the in cre men tal mac hi ne.
tran sla ti on is still to at le ast to my know led ge to my un der stan ding is still text ba sed tran sla ti on.
It just co mes a word at a ti me.
And that 's dif fe rent from the spe ech, which co mes a se cond at a ti me, like a a bit of so und at a ti me, so that the ti ming is dif fe rent.
Even if we even if we go for some in cre men tal thing.
Okay.
So this is in pic tu res, the am bi ti on, or the the sum mary of the two tec hno logi es that a re e xami ned by by o ur pro ject.
We a re trying to put to put to get her spe ech re cog ni ti on and mac hi ne tran sla ti on into spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on.
He re's, some his tory of ah, spe ech re cog ni ti on, we ha ven't re ally as a de par tment.
We have not re ally wor ked on spe ech re cog ni ti on.
So I just co pi ed this from from so mew he re.
And it se ems that the al re ady from the e ig hti es pe op le ran many sha red tasks and they im pro ved the the per for man ce of of the re cog ni ti on.
And here a ro und two to four per cent of word er ror ra te.
That is whe re hu mans a re with the ir pre cisi on and.
In e arly days.
In ni nete en ninty so met hing some systems got to the hu man per for man ce, then on con ver sa ti o nal spe ech, which is like un li mited is un li mited spe ech or me e tings pe op le.
The systems a re far from this from this ben chmark, but that has been chan ging, over the last ye ars thanks to the ne u ral net works.
So the swit chbo ard con ver sa ti o nal spe ech ben chmark that is 40 calls bet we en two ran dom English spe a kers the re.
The hu man le vel of six per cent has been kind of re ac hing 2017.
So that se ems like that spe ech re cog ni ti on.
If it is the right thing.
It can work e qu ally as e qu ally well as as hu mans do.
Then this is the the the his tory of mac hi ne tran sla ti on into Czech that yo u know, from pre vi ous pre sen ta ti ons of Mar tin Po pel, well, and also then from me.
This is o ur systems.
And the last o ne is the Su per Hu man mac hi ne tran sla ti on system from English into Czech in 2018.
Mar tin Po pel's set up was able to, to o ut per form hu man tran sla tors like pro fes si o nal tran sla tors but that was bulk tran sla ti on.
It was they.
They did not pay more at ten ti on to that, then the then look to the ir nor mal job.
So that was like the the a vera ge pro fes si o nal tran sla ti on qu a lity and e valu a ted sen ten ce by sen ten ce.
Uh, the set up by Mar tin Po pel was was sig ni ficantly bet ter than that.
Obvi ously, the re is many ca ve ats to uh, to uh, take into ac co unt.
But that is the that is the set ting.
Yo u have two tec hno logi es.
Yo u have spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on, which co uld be on par with hu mans, and yo u have mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
Uh.
So sorry, so yo u have spe ech re cog ni ti on, which co uld be on par with the hu mans and mac hi ne tran sla ti on, which co uld be on par with hu mans.
So that is whe re we sa id," let us join them.
Let us.
Let us get.
Let us make u se of this of the se gre at two ac hi e vements.
Let us put them to get her.
So in o ur pro ject, the ELITR.
Pro ject.
We a re trying to.
This will be badly mis re cog ni zed be ca u se it does not re cog ni ze any na mes. Well, so in the ELITR pro ject we a re put ting to get her spe ech re cog ni ti on and mac hi ne tran sla ti on in a highly mul ti lin gu al set ting. I will men ti on that la ter on.
Well, we a re co or di nating the pro ject, the Uni ver sity of Edin burgh, in clu ding us, o ur ex perts in mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
So to say. Kar lsru he is ex pert in spe ech re cog ni ti on.
We have the the top per for ming systems.
If we put them to get her.
I 'm sure it will work.
Gre at and Per wi se is an Ita li an com pany.
They have also been in vol ved in num ber of Eu rope an pro jects be fore, and they were al ways in the role of the in teg ra tor.
So they know how to put things to get her, and they have some ba seli ne systems that we can bu ild up on.
And then we have a user par tner Alfa vi ew, which is re mote con fe ren cing system whe re we wo uld like to tran sla te what pe op le what pe op le say in the in in the re mote calls and we have a not her user par tner.
And that 's the sup re me a u dit of fi ce of the Czech Re pub lic.
And.
The Sup re me Au dit Offi ce.
They a re to o af ra id of of do ing an ything bad with with fi nan cing.
So did they did not want to get a sin gle Eu ro.
So they a re not part of the pro ject, but they a re just an af fi li a ted user par tner.
So they a re not sup por ted by the Eu rope an com mis si on.
Uh, o kay.
So the am bi ti on.
The am bi ti on is is very big.
We want to sup port a Con gress that the Sup re me a u dit of fi ce.
Runs this ye ar.
At the end of May or e arly Ju ne, and the par ti cipants of that Con gress come from many co un tri es, and in so me, they spe ak 43 lan gu a ges.
So this is well bey ond the ca pacity of a uh of si mul ta ne ous in ter pre ting by hu mans, and we want to pro vide the mis sing lan gu a ges.
So to say, so, the re will be six lan gu a ges spo ken at that.
Con gress.
So English and French and Spa nish Ger man, Rus si an and Czech.
The se a re the of fi ci al lan gu a ges of the Con gress.
The se will be ma nu ally in ter pre ted ac ross so that all the six a re pro vided, and we a re to pro vide the re ma i ning 43 ot her.
The the re ma i ning that the rest of the 43 lan gu a ges.
So this set of EUROSAI lan gu a ges is lar ger than the set of the of fi cal EU lan gu a ges.
And that is also an im por tant re mark, be ca u se many of the se lan gu a ges a re much shor ter off of da ta.
So the Eu rope an com mis si on.
So the Eu rope an Uni on has al re ady put con si derab le ef forts into da ta.
So ur ces for some ye ars.
Ever ything from the Eu rope an Par li a ment was tran sla ted into all the lan gu a ges.
All the do cuments of the Eu rope an Uni on a re a va i lab le in all the lan gu a ges.
So we have so met hing to tra in on for the the se twenty four lan gu a ges, but less so for the se ni nete en ad di ti o nal lan gu a ges.
And some of the se lan gu a ges have even so a brand new or un cle ar sta tus, that no gram mar.
Bo oks were writ ten for them yet.
So that is that is a chal len ge on its own.
Okay.
Ye ah, so the e vents.
We know that this all sho uld run.
So we have al re ady star ted.
The pro ject has star ted last year in Ja nu ary, and in March.
We have ad ded o ne ex tra dry run.
So in o ur pro ject plan we ha ve.
We had like two dry run ses si ons.
And then the Con gress.
And we sa id, well, on the third at tempt to do e ver ything.
Well, so that as the 200 De lega tes, or 400.
If yo u co unt the de lega te and the ir and the ir fel low that the 400 pe op le will se e what what we have tes ted just twi ce be fore hand.
That is im pos sib le.
So we have ad ded num ber of a num ber of ot her e vents.
The first o ne.
What hap pe ned in March.
Last ye ar.
It was the stu dent fair of fa ke, firms like mock mock bu siness com pa ni es.
And the re we were tes ting the old and pre e xis ting tec hno logy what Kar lsru he had and what Per vo i ce had.
And we just ad ded o ur mac hi ne tran sla ti on system from English into Czech. Then we also got in to uch with the, I do not know the cor rect English name of the de par tment, but the De par tment for in ter pre ting and tran sla ti on and the fa culty of arts of o ur u niver sity.
[0:12:21]And thanks to the ir sup port we a re able to at tend the ir Mock Con fe ren ces whe re the in ter pre ters a re get ting tra i ned.
And we a re re cor ding the se mul tip le in ter pre ters, and like se eing what o ur systems can do with that mul tip le in puts.
So this is, this is like si milar set ting whe re the re is in ter pre ters in the bo oths, and we a re trying to fol low what they a re say ing and com ple ment it with the, with the ot her lan gu a ges.
And then we had the two of fi ci al e vents that were plan ned for o ur uh, for o ur pro ject that o ne was a wor king gro up on va lu e ad ded tax, which hap pe ned in Ju ne.
And then right af ter the sum mer in Octo ber, the re was a not her me e ting.
So the se two e vents were like qu i te clo se to each ot her.
uh, ye ah, so not much the de velop ment was pos sib le bet we en the se two e vents.
And then in No vem ber, we also ad ded o ne mo re.
I was sho wing this tec hno logy in a lit tle demo on the Matfyz Open Do ors Day and I was also trying to pre sent it at Best of Pra qu e AI e vent.
And then in Feb ru ary, so very re cently, we had a wor kshop, a dry run of a wor kshop, which will also run at the Con gress.
And the re the pur po se of the wor kshop is to de mon stra te not only mac hi ne tran sla ti on, but all ot her text pro ces sing or NLP tec hno logi es to the a u di en ce, to the lay u sers, the sup re me a u ditors to il lus tra te how the NLP to ols can help them in the ir bu siness.
And we a re go ing to run this wor kshop ob vi ously in English, and the re will be the lan gu a ge bar ri ers so the, uh, the a u ditors wo uld like to se e some tran sla ti ons of, of that.
So the suc ces sful demo was only in No vem ber.
This was the big fa i lure, be ca u se the, the wi fi did not start.
I will men ti on that la ter on.
And then at the Lang To ols wor kshop.
Ever ything wor ked well but it was ac tu ally still pretty u seless for the u sers.
And and ho pefully yo u will se e in the fol lo wing sli des why this is the ca se.
This is the up co ming e vents.
The re is a ga in the Mock Con fe ren ces at Fa culty of Art.
We will a ga in try to se e them.
The re is a not her in stan ce of the Stu dent Firms Fa ir, we a re a ga in trying to uh, to get to that, be ca u se the se, the high scho ol stu dents from ac ross the Eu rope pro vide be au tifully non na tive spe ech.
So they a re very hard to uh, to un der stand for the ASR systems.
So we, we get the test sets the re and we a re ma king it a sha red task to un der stand the se high sho ol stu dents.
Then, uh, yes, this is the, this is the sha red task whe re we a re trying to get also ot her re se arch in sti tutes to, to pro cess that data the, the high scho ol stu dents.
And then we will have a se cond dry run of o ur wor kshop.
May be we will add some ot her things.
And the main e vent is e arly Ju ne, uh, in, uh, here in Pra gu e.
And they a re all the Mon day se minars, so a ga in at e very Mon day se minar yo u will have a chan ce to, to se e the se sub tit les.
OK.
So here is a very bri ef re port on last March e vent,
the Stu dent Firms Fa ir.
The re was o ne spe a ker also that,
like
we put the mike to, not only the stu dents,
Tomáš Sed láček, the Czech e cono mist.
And yo u se e that it, the the old system wor ked pretty well in clu ding o ur Czech tran sla ti ons.
So he was spe a king, and it was re cog ni zing him.
It was re cog ni zing sen ten ces.
So for a bo ut a mi nute, we had a per fect show.
And that was it from thre e days,
we had like o ne mi nute.
So we, we star ted blog ging.
And and we, we blog ged a bo ut all o ur suc ces ses
on o ur web pa ge.
Blog ging is fun, uh, so, uh, ye ah.
So, uh, with blog ging
yo u im me di a tely feel fa mo us.
It does not re ally mat ter,
if an yo ne fol lows yo u, just the fact that yo u pos ted so mew he re that.
That ma kes yo u feel fa mo us, and yo u can also so meti mes im pro ve the re a lity a bit.
So, uh, ye ah, well, we do not do pho tos hop ping of o ur
de mos. The only thing what we do is we se lect the bits
whe re it wor ked. So from tho se two day e vents
it was o ne mi nute, and but we a re gro wing big ger.
So, so ho pefully the re will be al most, al most 50 mi nutes of to day, which will be sub tit led thro ug ho ut the who le ses si on.
So I said at the be gin ning, ASR and MT,
the se a re per fect tec hno logi es.
They work very well.
They a re su per hu man.
Yo u just plug them to get her.
Well, it is not qu i te like that.
Yo u still need to ac qu i re the so und, yo u need to get the in put, and yo u need to pre sent the o ut put.
[17:12] And the re is also the lit tle clash.
The spe ech re cog ni ti on re cog ni zes words, but we a re re ady to tran sla te sen ten ces.
So what yo u need to do is yo u need to seg ment
that stre am of words into sen ten ces
and then only yo u can tran sla te them.
So that ac tu ally that ac tu ally still re qu i res yo u to to add o ne more com po nents, some some seg men ter seg men ta ti on wor ker, and yo u also need to ship all the se bits of stre am to the va ri ous wor kers a long the pi peli ne.
So the the two steps just put the two steps to get her set up
is ac tu ally this this com pli cated.
So this is the o verall ar chi tec tu re.
It is bu ilds upon so met hing which Per Vo i ce de velo ped in in the pre vi ous pro jects,
it is cal led the Per Vo i ce plat form.
And, uh, the se com po nents, all the se com po nents of spe ech re cog ni ti on, and all all that, con nect to cen tral po int cal led the me di a tor, and yo u have a cli ent.
That cli ent con nects to that me di a tor.
The me di a tor ships it
to the ASR, then to sen ten ce seg men ter then to mac hi ne tran sla ti on
and then to pre sen ta ti on.
And the pre sen ta ti on de livers it to the web.
And we have just re ce i ved like a con fir ma ti on that this sin gle word,
this se cond of so und was pro ces sed a long the who le pi peli ne.
So this,
and this runs ac ross the Eu rope.
So some of the se com po nents run here in this bu il ding.
[18:16] So me of them run so mew he re in the clo ud of Per Vo i ce,
some run in Edin burgh, some run in Kar lsru he.
So that is, it is dis tri buted.
The con nec ti ons a re al ways open and they a re re u sed ac ross the cli ents uh but uh, it uses o ne par ti cular type of Inter net com mu nica ti on, the TCP pro tocol.
And that re qu i res that the net work is is very bro ad in in the con nec ti on.
So that it,
it does not col lect any de lay,
any lag. This is the set up that also in clu des the wi ring.
So yo u need to like con nect the the mac hi nes that the mic rop ho nes and and con nect the pre sen ting system to the scre en, and all that.
And this is the se tup for the EUROSAI Con gress, whe re the re is six in ter pre ters bo oth in all the many, on the many six, all the six lan gu a ges that the hu mans in ter pret in to.
And the re we a re col lec ting all tho se and, and cho o sing which o ne of them to tran sla te from and then tran sla te to all the re ma i ning 30, so met hing lan gu a ges.
So the se tup is, a re com pli cated.
This is the wor kers con nec ted to the me di a tor plat form, and yo u se e that some of them a re busy and some of them a re a va i lab le.
So this, this is like a big in fras truc tu re.
So let us start with some of the is su es.
Obvi ously the net work can slow things down.
[19:43]So once we face the fact that in Con sul whe re the re was some con struc ti on or wha tever.
For some re a son, the u niver sity had a lit tle slo wer Inter net ac cess.
And that de lay ed all o ur pro ces sing.
So im me di a tely, we were not li ve.
But we were like se conds or do zens of se conds la ter than the sig nal.
So yo u yo u sho uld be ac tu ally on sta ge or very clo se to the ve nu e,
if yo u want to de liver si mul ta ne ous spe ech re li ably.
For test, this is not a prob lem.
But if yo u want to do it live yo u yo u,
yo u sho uld not rely on on the Inter net.
And this was the prob lem
at the best of Pra gu e AI ses si on whe re I have tes ted e ver ything.
It wor ked per fectly for the de mo.
Uh, un for tu nately, even like I have as ked a month be fore hand
and then for the se cond ti me, I was not al lo wed to con nect my mac hi ne to a
wi red con nec ti on.
I had to rely on wi fi.
And e ver ything wor ked twi ce when I was at the ve nu e, I tes ted it.
Then the a u di en ce came and the a u di en ce bro ught the ir cell pho nes.
No body ac tu ally u se the Inter net.
The the cell pho nes were just trying to like look a ro und is the re any in ter nal a va i lab le, and they tri ed to con nect.
And and may be just the se tests simply kil led the wi fi.
And it did not work for me at all.
So not hing was ever re cog ni zed at that e vent for me.
So,
so we must not rely on wire wi reless con nec ti on.
Then we also had is su es whe re e ver ything went well, ex cept the the fi nal pre sen ta ti on was like fil ling buf fers off web brow sers.
So
it was not sho wing pro perly on the end user de vices.
Ever ything was OK un til the fi nal pre sen ta ti on po int.
And this is a not her,
this is like
miss con fi gura ti on er ror like if yo u a re jug gling with with the se tups.
It is easy to make a mis ta ke.
So in o ne of the ses si ons,
we were ob ser ving some hor rib le
de lay ga i ning or gro wing.
And the re a son was that we a re in o ur own ASR system, be ca u se we a re also ex pe rimen ting with that.
And we ran it lo cally but, ac ci den tally,
we were first sen ding the so und over wi fi to Italy, and then sen ding it back to o ur pla ce to re cog ni ze it.
And only then we we re,
we were re cog ni zing it.
So, this do ub le do ub le net work load has kil led the, has ca u sed the de lay.
Next time we, we like re cog ni zed it on the spot
and and the the prob lem was go ne.
OK.
Now, so und ac qu i siti on.
Yo u may re cog ni ze some of uh, o ne of o ur col le a gu es he re.
And the prob lem is if if yo u have this mic rop ho ne, that chest mic rop ho ne, and yo u put it he re.
And then yo u talk to the sli ce like that.
The mic rop ho ne does not re ally get your ways.
So that is, that is o ne prob lem.
This is a not her thing right now,
un for tu nately,
we had to switch off this chest mike and I am rel ying on this mo uth
mi ke. We wan ted to ex tend this test.
So ba sed on thre e mi nutes of tes ting, the er ror in re cog ni zing English and Czech is se veral po ints lo wer,
if yo u u se the mo uth mic rop ho ne com pa red to the chest mic rop ho ne.
So that is just the dis tan ce from the mo uth and the mo vement of the head that ma kes me a surab le me a surab le dif fe ren ce.
So we a re rel ying on the on the bet ter on the head mic rop ho ne.
Ye ah, this is a tip for sin gers,
for vo calists.
Yo u have to hold the mike pro perly,
yo u have yo u have not,
yo u must not put it in your mo uth
al mos t.Yo u must not put it to o far away from your mo uth.
And al so, if yo u stand in front of the lo ud spe a kers, the re ver be rati ons, will will to tally kill the sig nal that yo u a re re ce i ving thro ugh the mi ke.
So this is what has hap pe ned to us du ring the uh, the Stu dent Firm Fa irs, when the stu dents were were just ro a ming a ro und,
and they en te red the area in front of the lo ud spe a kers.
And sud denly the re was no way to to re cog ni ze them. OK.
Then, the re is cab les.
Yo u have to plug the cab les pro perly
and o ne of the se set tings in the con fe ren cing room for the in ter pre ters,
we were able to get the sig nal
only when o ne of the con nec tors here was not fully plug ged in.
The re a son is that we were like mi susing the con nec ti ons so once once we bro ught a pro per so und card,
it was able to re cog ni se which pin of that con nec tor has what, but wit ho ut a pro per so und card, with just the bu ild in so und card of stan dard no tebo ok,
yo u have to like mi salign the pins of that con nec tor to get the sig nal.
So the re was an hour or two of de bug ging un til we' ve fi gured o ut how to con nect the in put, so that's we' re le ar ning.
So then the re is the vo lume set ting a long the a long the pi peli ne.
So if yo u have a wi reless mic rop ho ne.
It has a re ce i ver, and the re is vo lume con trol at the re ce i ver, and then yo u have a so und card, and that also has some vo lume con trol
and it also has some but ton, like two but tons.
So line le vel or mic le vel that is o ne but ton and pad ding on or off.
So yo u have to that's like four op ti ons, at le ast just for the but tons, and then for the for the for the knobs, and yo u have to set this
pro perly ot her wi se the so und can be to o qu iet, or the so und will be to o to o high,
If the the vo lume wo uld be to o high and so me o ne a long the pi peli ne will clip it
and then yo u don't get the fre qu en ci es, and the ASR will not work.
So yo u need to ca refully track the sig nals step by step, ex pe ri en ced pe op le know.
I re mem ber the the col le a gu e from the Per Vo i ce com pany who came for the stu dent fa res for the first time
and the re we still were strug gling with get ting the sig nal right.
And he like fol lo wed from the mic with the he ad pho nes al ways con nec ted it he ad pho nes and sa id, OK it's good he re, it's good here and
step by step,
he ma naged to de liver the the right vo lume to the mac hi ne so that's yo u have to do it step wi se, and it can fail at any po int.
Yep. So then ASR qu a lity.
So once yo u have de live red the pos sib le the best pos sib le sig nal, what does the mac hi ne re cog ni ze from that.
So this is an e xam ple from the from the stu dent, the high scho ol stu dents.
The spe a ker wan ted to say so met hing like yo u have a bot tle?. Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in the he art in the he art of České bud ějo vice.
But in re a lity, this is high scho ol stu dent, so he sa id, "yo u have a bot tle?
Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in hard of České bud ějo vice", so the re was se ri ous mis pro nun ci a ti on, and the re was also high le vel of bac kgro und no i se, be ca u se that is fa ir,
so the re is stands with mu sic play ing,
and we a re just be hind a lit tle a lit tle wall,
ho ping to get some some shel ter from from all that no i ce.
So if yo u a re u nex per , if yo u a re a per son and yo u a re in this here in this in this harsh con di ti ons, then yo u pro bably un der stand so met hing
like yo u have a bot tle, be ca u se yo u a re not ex pec ting the the stu dent to talk a bo ut a ho tel on the bo at,
"Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in the he art of", and then he wo uld re cog ni ze that some ci ti es be ing men ti o ned,
but if he is from Spa in, he wo uld not know that České bud ějo vice, yo u know, is a is a is a Czech city.
The stan dard ASR wo uld de liver so met hing li ke, oh, yes, the the of the that is the the few words the ASR can spot in the in the no i se sig nal
if the ASR is is no i se re sis tant, if it can so mehow can cel the no i se, then it will do so met hing
"yo u have so mebody to oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in hard, which is can we do?" be ca u se it does not know the the name of the Czech city.
And if we have a fu ture ASR or a per son in the in the mid dle ac tu ally, and then we wo uld get the the pro per re cog ni ti on of the sen ten ce.
So this is this is all the prob lems that that we a re fa cing when we a re trying to tran scri be a non na tive spe a kers.
This is sum mary ac ross the re cor dings that we have made the re, so re mem ber, the word" er ror" rate for hu mans is a ro und six or four per cent,
he re, the Go og le system, Go og le ASR had er ror rate of of ni net yish.
Edin burgh system al so, and car system was ac tu ally the best o ne a ro und 40, still ten ti mes wor se than what the hu mans do.
And this is this is on the re cor dings were all the systems have pro duced any o ut put what so e ver.
If we apply if we if plot the same fi gures but we co unt 100 per cent of er rors as the the the sco re if no o ut put is de live red then
Go og le is so much wor se than Edin burgh so Edin burgh was was bet ter, was not like gi ving up so fre qu ently.
And Car los was still still the best system, but still the the car system is ten ti mes wor se than the hu mans
and that's then what is re por ted in the li tera ture.
Obvi ously, this is hard con di ti ons.
So this is bac kgro und, no i se, non na tive spe a kers, well, we a re not yet qu i te pro fes si o nally in the re cor ding
so we just mi salig ned, the mics, and pe op le like spo ke to o loud and we did not twist the knobs pro perly.
So it is it is very harsh con di ti ons but this is the the the re a lity that that yo u can get.
So this is the best re cor ding ac cor ding to the ASR qu a lity, and the re a re things li ke, "why do yo u wear tho se so high he els"
in ste ad of "why do yo u wear tho se high heat the high he els".
And de als, the re is "I know o ne re ally good star", in ste ad of "sto re", "that de als with the sale of free down fo od", in ste ad of "fre e ti me, fo ot we ar",
or so met hing like that, so it is it is the to tally wrong.
Ok, so what is o ur plan, gi ven this.
So we a re de fini tely go ing to ret ra in o ur ASR mo dels, and I i de ally we wo uld like to u se non na tive spe ech cor po ra,
com mon vo i ce by Mo zil la is o ne of this is that that can help.
And we have a not her fal lback uh, the thing to do.
We wo uld like to fol low in ter pre ters in ste ad of the flo or, be ca u se each of the in ter pre ters will sit in a bo oth with li mited no i se
from sur ro un dings with bet ter mic rop ho ne. So we have more con trol of the re cor ding, we can also talk to the in ter pre ters and ex pla in to them
that they a re be ing re cor ded and pro ces sed in par ti cular way, and we also have the chan ce to a dapt to them.
So we a re trying to get the ir con tacts. We have still few months to co me.
And even if they a re non na tive, we sho uld be able to a dapt to the ir par ti cular spe ech.
So we wo uld ask them to do as uh,
well, few mi nutes, uh pos sibly up to an hour of of re cor ding we wo uld pay them to wha tever,
read some text or or in ter pret so met hing .And then we wo uld to cre a te a tra i ning da taset for that par ti cular per son.
And then ob vi ously, we a re go ing gat her in do ma in da taset and re gularly e valu a te.
So does the ASR.
We get the text, so what do we, what do we ex pect now, with the tran sla ti on the re a re all the stan dard tran sla ti on er rors that yo u know whe re well.
So here is o ne e xam ple, a sen ten ce, which was ac tu ally re cog ni zed per fectly.
I know which sen ten ces a re re cog ni zed per fectly, so I know what to a vo id when I 'm run ning de mo.
This is also dif fe rent from the from the u sers of o ur system, they will simply spe ak as they a re used to.
If I want to show ca se what o ur system is do ing I will a vo id na med en ti ti es, I will a vo id stran ge con struc ti ons,
I will have like flu ent new spa per li ke style of sen ten ces, and then all the all the systems will suc ces sfully re cog ni ze me.
So this is o ne of the the ca ses.
But it is much more dif fi cult to to ask if yo u do not have any clu e, and yet, the tran sla ti ons, both into Ger man,
two sam ple lan gu a ges were wrong, the if was tran sla ted as ob or as da.
And that is that dis torts the dis torts the the sen se of of that.
So my gu ess is that may be in English, yo u wo uld, in in Na tive English, yo u wo uld ac tu ally say this a lit tle bit dif fe rently.
And then the re might be more ex pli cit clue in the so ur ce sen ten ce. I 'm not say ing that the sen ten ce in English is wrong.
I 'm say ing that in de ed tra i ning da ta, which is from news or may be bo oks, or or or EU le gis la ti on.
The re is this like do ma in mis match and even even if it is not do ma in mis match.
This is is ge nu inly am bi gu ous con jun cti on, and it is dif fi cult for the mac hi ne to gu ess the me a ning.
So if yo u a re clo ser to the tra i ning da ta, then yo u will se e it will work bet ter.
If if it is a dif fi cult, an am bi gu ous ex pres si on.
Yo u will have the se prob lems till like for e ver. Ye ah,
here is some some just mi sun der stan ding or well, as the it was o ut of vo cabu lary, the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system ran o ut of vo cabu lary:
"yo u can be re por ted af ter some pro fani ti es".
So if yo u if yo u say so met hing bad on your web si te, then they will flow like block yo u.
And that was the most tran sla ted as pro fes si o nal things.
That is be ca u se the pro fani ti es, were not in the in the vo cabu lary of the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system.
So the re sor ted to some ex pres si ons.
Okay, ah, the prob lem in spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on is that the ASR er rors get kind of mul tip li ed in mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
If yo u have an er ror in spe ech re cog ni ti on.
Then the er ror will be a few e dits a sin gle word si milar in sha pe the what I have sa id.
But then yo u take this sin gle word and yo u tran sla te it, and then the sha pe of the word like to tally chan ges.
So, mac hi ne tran sla ti on ta kes all the wrong words from the ASR as fully of trus tworthy and hap pily re or ders a sen ten ce to make it
the best pos sib le sen ten ce, in clu ding tho se wrong words, and the re is no in for ma ti on a bo ut the con fi den ce, ne it her from the ASR system,
nor from the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system.
So the so the user will be just left with the sen ten ce, which so unds per fectly na tural love men ti on some stran ge en ti ti es,
which were ne ver ne ver men ti o ned ne ver part of the talk, be ca u se they come they come from an er ror.
So here is an e xam ple, "and the goal of my the sis is to fold", and that was "two fol d".So in ste ad of "two fold",
the ASR re cog ni zes "to fa ult", that is the na tural like mis re cog ni ti on. The empty o ut put was,
"and the goal of my the ory", in ste ad of "the sis", "is to fall a part".
So that's de fini tely not what what we were af ter in this system, ye ah.
So this is this is what I wo uld pro bably tran sla ted to o if I was tran sla ting it.
I just wan ted to hig hlight this "two fold" is mis re cog ni zed as "to fold" was tran sla ted as "roz dro bit se", to fall a part.
And that is to tally o ut of o ut of the sco pe. Ok.
So what we ha ve, what what is o ur plan for the mis si on tran sla ti on, da ta, data da ta, and then may be lit tle bit of mo dels.
So we a re de fini tely go ing to gat her more pa ral lel da ta. Uni ver sity of Edin burgh is wor king on that.
We a re go ing to gat her more tar get si de, mo nolin gu al data and back tran sla te, that's for the do ma in a dap ta ti ons. So this is a u diting do ma in.
so we wo uld like to, uh, to fo cus on all the se ma teri als Uh, they a re hardly pa ral lel,
some of them a re, but not to o many, and es pe ci ally not for, uh, tho se, uh, like 19, uh, non EU lan gu a ges that we a re al so, uh, oh, a i ming at.
So ho pefully o ur, uh, ba seli ne systems in the back tran sla ti on will make some sen sib le o ut put from that, and ho pefully we'll be able
to im pro ve the tran sla ti on qu a lity.
We'll cre a te in do ma in test sets, and we will re gularly e valu a te on them.
We'll also try to, uh, uh, get, uh, in to uch, uh, with <UNKNOWN>, that's a col lec ti on of, uh, user sup pli ed, uh,
pa ral lel da ta, and, uh, they can, gi ven o ur test sets, they can ex tract the most si milar sen ten ces,
so, uh, some like fil te ring off off lar ger, uh, pool of, uh, pa ral lel da ta.
We'll also try to cre a te ga zet te ers, so lists of re levant na med en ti ti es like par ti cipants, or or the pre sidents of the Sup re me Au dit Offi ces.
Uh, this is, uh, ha ving just the list of na mes, uh, is not i de al for, uh, for mac hi ne tran sla ti on, but it's de fini tely bet ter than not hing,
so we'll, we'll try this as well. I'm also con si dering,
and this is so met hing that may be so me o ne of yo u co uld try, I'm con si dering to to tra in mac hi ne tran sla ti on on dis tor ted so ur ce,
uh, be ca u se I wo uld pre fer the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system to say so met hing in the do ma in and sen sib le, rat her than to, uh, to li ke, uh, uh,
try to, uh, per fectly tran sla te the wrong ASR o ut put, uh,
so for me, ten ta tively, I'm say ing that, uh, it se ems to be bet ter to say so met hing si milar or re lated, uh,
rat her than, uh, uh, like do per fect tran sla ti on of the wrong in put.
It, we'll se e whet her this, uh, is a good as sum pti on or not, if if the system starts ma king up the con tent,
then ob vi ously, the u sers will not be happy as well, but, uh, right now, uch, uch, uch,
o ur system is to o easy to, to, li ke, uh, to, to, to, to, um, that, to, it is to o easy to to no tice that o ur system is do ing so met hing wrong,
and, uh, we want to hide it a, uh, uh, bit un der the car pet,
so let's se e if this will be a good stra tegy or not and let's se e if we ma nage to tra in such a, uh, mo del.
And I'm af ra id that we will ne ver get, du ring this few months, uh, to the in te res ting things like the spe a ker's gen der.
Uh, ob vi ously, uh, the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system has no in for ma ti on a bo ut the gen der of the spe ech.
Uh, the pa ral lel da ta, uh, is to tally li ke, uh, non la bel led, u oo uh,
it do esn't know a bo ut that fact e it her,
and, uh, uh, English do esn't, uh, mark most sen ten ces for the gen der of the spe a ker, uh,
so it's very li kely that o ur system will be just ma king up and swit ching the gen der of the, of the spe a ker, uh, in the first per son sen ten ces, uh,
and that will be very con fu sing for the a u di en ce.
So, uh, I'm af ra id that we will not get to this, un less the re is so me o ne who wo uld like to help. Okay.
Then the in teg ra ti on of the ASR and MT.Uh, I've al re ady sa id, uh, ASR e mits strings of
lo wer ca se words, uh, mac hi ne tran sla ti on ex pects in di vidu al cor rect sen ten ces,
so the re' re a num ber of op ti ons that we can try to, uh, uh, brid ge the gap.
So we can try to in sert pun ctu a ti on into the ASR o ut put, uh, which we call the seg men ter, uh, or, uh, we can chan ge the ASR, uh, to pre dict di rectly
cor rect pun ctu a ti on, so the spe ech re cog ni ti on wo uld run not in to, uh, just se qu en ce of words, but se qu en ce of words with pun ctu a ti on and
ca pita liza ti on. And a stu dent of mine is is wor king on this. And we can also try so met hing which is o ne of the re se arch go als of o ur pro ject, uh,
that's fully end to end spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on, uh, with o ne ne u ral system that, uh, gets the so und in o ne lan gu a ge and pro duces, uh,
the tran sla ti on in the, uh, in the tar get lan gu a ge right a way, so that's a ga in part of, uh, Pe ter's, uh, the sis.
So the seg men ter, gi ven a stre am of words, gu ess pun ctu a ti on, ca sing, we u se, uh, uh, Otto kar Tilk's to ol, so, so me o ne's to ol.
Unfor tu nately, the spe ech in for ma ti on is no lon ger ac ces sib le to this to ol, so it has just the se qu en ce of words, and ba sed on the se qu en ce of words,
it is gu es sing sen ten ce bo un da ri es. And as, uh, o ne of, uh, my col le a gu es, uh, from the <UNKNOWN> spe ci a lists sa id, uh, it's ac tu ally do ing very good job gi ven
that it do esn't have any in for ma ti on a bo ut the pa u ses, a bo ut the in to nati on, so it's sur pri sing how well it can pre dict the sen ten ce bo un da ri es
with this, uh, poor in for ma ti on. Uh, so, still, it is it is far from per fect, so the re' re many er rors.
Uh, the re is also a not her to ol, which wo uld con si der the in to nati on and and de lays, but we ha ven't had time to in teg ra te it,
so if so me o ne wo uld like to, uh, play a ro und with that we will be happy to, uh, uh, to, uh, to get any help the re.
So, uh, <UNKNOWN> has tra i ned this, uh, this, uh, seg men ter to ol, on, uh, <UNKNOWN> da ta, a bo ut four mil li on sen ten ces,
and, uh, here is the pre cisi ons and re calls for va ri ous pun ctu a ti on marks that we a re in ser ting, uh, and h'am, uh, hig hlig hting the re call of, uh,
pe ri od, be ca u se that is cri tical to to i den tify sen ten ce bo un da ri es, uh, so, uh, it's, uh, 70 to to 80 per cent, which is re a sonab le, uh, uh,
if yo u look at it as a num ber, but it is still far from suf fi ci ent for, uh, prac ti cal, uh, u se.
Uh, o kay. So, uh, here is an e xam ple, uh, of an er ror in, uh, in, uh, in the, uh, in the, uh, in the seg men ta ti on, so er rors in pre cisi on, uh, lead to con fu sing empty o ut put,
so here the spe a ker said so met hing like "all to o well", uh, that was part of a lon ger, uh, uh, lon ger, uh, phra se,
and, uh, the ASR plus seg men ter, uh, put a full stop bet we en this, like in the mid dle of this phra se, uh, le a ding to the o ut put
"This ap pro ach does not ge nera lize all to o", and then se para te sen ten ce, "Well, so to so mehow con clu de that the who le talk",
so here the se man tics is ob vi ously chan ged, eh, qu i te a bit, uh, this is e xactly the case whe re the mac hi ne tran sla ti on wo uld, uh ,o ne by o ne re ce i ve the first sen ten ce,
and then the se cond sen ten ce, and it wo uld have no way to re cover from, uh, from the full stop, which sho uld not be the re in the first pla ce.
So, uh, the re the two sen ten ces wo uld get, uh, li ke, be au tiful, uh, but, uh, the, ye ah, the mes sa ge wo uld be dis tor ted. Errors in re call, uh,
ma ke, uh, to o much con tent un stab le, and we'll ex pla in this, uh, on on on the fol lo wing sli des. Uh, ye ah.
So, here is a not her, uh, tec hni cal thing, uh, the the mes sa ging bet we en the spe ech re cog ni ti on and and spo ken English tran sla ti on.
Uh, so it's, if it is the on li ne spe ech re cog ni ti on, uh, we a re re ce i ving text mes sa ges, uh, but the se text mes sa ges of strings of words
a re not re lated to sen ten ce bo un da ri es. Uh, so in the first run, and this is what we, uh, what we were mostly se eing in in March, or at all
the ses si ons, uh, that were the tests for for the Sup re me Au dit Offi ce, we were re ce i ving, uh, the se mes sa ges, so
this is the first mes sa ge, the se cond mes sa ge, third mes sa ge and fo urth mes sa ge, and we were di rectly sen ding the se mes sa ges, uh,
to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on, um, so, uh, the first mes sa ge was "Yo u sho uld thank the re ha ve", and the re, that's still un fi nis hed sen ten ce.
Uh, mac hi ne tran sla ti on system, gi ven this in put, de cided to to tally omit the first sen ten ce, be ca u se the first sen ten ce, li ke,
do esn't fit the re, the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system is tra i ned to tran sla te full sen ten ce into full sen ten ce, so some half a sen ten ce, uh,
he re, let let's drop it, so it said just, just "Děku ji", že "Thank yo u". And then, uh, the, uh, this is an ex ten si on of that mes sa ge,
so the ASR sent a ga in, uh, the same pre fix, and then it ad ded the ex tra words that came in the me an ti me.
Uh, this is pro bably the best tran sla ti on that the MT co uld have de live red for that, and then the ASR sent so met hing which we call
the con fir ma ti on mes sa ge, so the ASR says, well, "I will not bot her with the se thre e words an ymo re, 'Yo u sho uld thank', I'll just, uh,
I'm fin fi nali zing the se, and from now on, I will only send yo u the rest, 'The re have been many re volu ti ons'".
So here is a sin gle mes sa ge, "Yo u sho uld thank", so that's o ne com ple te sen ten ce, and a be gin ning of a not her sen ten ce, and we have
tran sla ted it as as if it was o ne sen ten ce, and that's that's just wrong, and then, uh, the next mes sa ge stars in the mid dle of the sen ten ce al re ady,
and we a re a ga in fe e ding it as if it was a com ple te sen ten ce, so the re is, uh, li ke, the sen ten ce bo un da ri es a re to tally u nob ser ved by o ur ap pro ach,
and that that kills e ver ything, it it e mits, uh, it it up gra des all of the se par ti al sen ten ces into full sen ten ces, but that's not re lated to the,
uh, uh, to what the, uh, to what the pe op le sa id. Okay, so if yo u put to get her, uh, the, uh, the ASR and MT bet ter, and we did it and I'll show yo u on the fol lo wing sli des,
then yo u still need to pre sent so mehow the re sult, so that's we' re slowly co ming to wards the the fi nal sta ge, and still,
it can to tally kill the the show. Uh. Sss. If yo u have a font to o small, such as in the sub tit les, if they were a lit tle bit smal ler, it,
they will not be of any u se for yo u at all. So yo u need to very ca refully ba lan ce like how much con tent yo u put so mew he re,
and if the font wo uld be, uh, le gib le, if it still, if it's le gib le for pe op le in the first row, and for the pe op le in the last row,
if they have to rely on the cell pho ne and sud denly they have a dif fe rent sha pe, a dif fe rent rec tan gu lar area whe re whe re the, uh, tran sla ti ons
and tran scrip ti ons and ap pe ar, and this he a vily af fects how much in for ma ti on we can send them, and we have to dyna mically de cide what what to sent them
and and what not. Uh, for e xam ple then, if if if this text flick ers to o much, if the words chan ge to o qu ickly, yo u can not read them.
Uh, so that is o ne of the re a sons why we have not em ploy ed, uh, the fully, uh, ne u ral net work ASR system so far, be ca u se they a re tra i ned
to o pera te on win dow that mo ves in ti me. Uh, so, uh, e ight se conds, uh, at o ne go a re al ways re cog ni zed, and the be gin ning can chan ge,
so, uh, i magi ne e ight se conds of my spe ech back, and still like re deci ding what is the first word. As mostly the words do not chan ge,
but so meti mes they do, and if yo u have this long pi e ce of text, and it, li ke, swaps here and the re, uh, the re and back on on va ri ous, uh, pla ces
in in va ri ous words, yo u do not know how to fol low that, it's it's like un stab le text. So we a re wor king on this, uh, on this in teg ra ti on.
And, uh, I wan ted to hig hlight, that this pre sen ta ti on must be tes ted on sta ge, yo u can not test it in si mula ti on, li ke, uh,
the the si zing of the text, the vi sibi lity from va ri ous a re as, that all can, uh, um, kill it, can ne gati vely af fect it in such a way that
it's not u sab le at all. If yo u have ever or de red so met hing from an e shop, and it ca me, but it was like the wrong si ze, e it her to o small or to o big,
then yo u know what I'm tal king a bo ut. If, in in an e shop yo u have a pic tu re of what yo u' re buy ing, but the pic tu re is o ut of pro por ti on,
yo u yo u don't know if yo u' re get ting this big teddy be ar, or or this tiny teddy be ar, uh, so it's it can be of wrong si ze,
and that's the same thing as, uh, here for, uh, for the sub tit les. So here is, uh, o ne, uh, of the vi ews that, uh, yo u have be en,
may be yo u have been wat ching on your mac hi nes. Uh, this is ma inly for show ca sing that we can run the tran sla ti on into many tar get lan gu a ges, uh,
so we a re sho wing two li nes of sub tit les, uh, in, uh, ten lan gu a ges at the mo ment, and this will be 40, uh, 43.
Uh, this is good to de mon stra te that the system is fol lo wing me, and it can cre a te, uh, fal sely po siti ve im pres si on, uh, be ca u se
if yo u' re fol lo wing me, and if yo u un der stand my my lan gu a ge, then, uh, yo u can not, yo u can no lon ger read ca refully what is in the in the sub tit les,
and yo u will only ob ser ve the right key words the re, so if I say so met hing a bo ut sub tit les, and yo u will se e "ti tulky" in Czech then yo u will no tice,
oh, gre at, the system is re cog ni zing this per son, but yo u a re not able to jud ge the qu a lity of the sen ten ces.
So the sen ten ces, in fact, a re pretty crappy, and they jump to o qu ickly, and if yo u, if yo u did not un der stand me and yo u only had the se two li nes to fol low,
then yo u wo uld get lost in the er rors of ASR and MT. So this is this is good to show off, but it's bad for the u ser.
So we have so met hing el se, we also show, uh, much lon ger con text, uh, so, uh, the, the text as it grows. And he re, uh, yo u ha ve, uh, I don't know if this was pro bably gi ven in English,
and then it was tran sla ted in to, uh, Czech, uh, and Ger man, uh, and here yo u al re ady se e the dif fe ren ce bet we en the stab le o ut put, the par ti al o ut put
and the, li ke, the in co ming o ut put. Uh, so, some of the sen ten ces a re fully pro ces sed by all the pi peli ne, all the com po nents in the pi peli ne,
and the re is no way they co uld be up da ted any lon ger. And the se sen ten ces a re shown in, uh, a re shown in black, uh, and then, uh, the re' re sen ten ces,
which a re, uh, gra du ally, uh, be ing up da ted, and here still the pun ctu a ti on can, uh, can like make a dif fe ren ce, so that's why we' re only sho wing this only in gray.
And then the re is the last sen ten ce, which is still get ting more and more words.And as the seg men ter fi nis hes pro ces sing of some of this
then the full some full stop here will ap pe ar. And it will be o ut of the uh, the pro ces sing area of of the seg men ter an ymo re, and it will be come
the black and fully stab le o ut put. He re yo u se e why the full stop re call is im por tant. If the full stop a re to o scar ce they a re to o in fre qu ent
in the o ut put, then to o much of text will re ma in in this gray fase and to o much of text will like be still un de cided and flick e ring.
Pe op le will wait wait to o long for the stab le o ut put. And yo u also that it is also like mat ter of tas te, whet her pe op le wo uld like to fol low the more
the more un stab le more re cent o ut put, or whet her they wo uld like to fol low only the stab le o ne, but be se veral se conds be hind the spe a ker.
So that that dif fers. So this is so met hing that we have to up da te. And i de ally, it wo uld be the u sers cho i ce.
Wo uld yo u like to have the the the shor test pos sib le de lay at the risk of the re a ding so met hing which will be still like fi xed,
or wo uld yo u like to wait lit tle lon ger un til o ur o ut put is stab le. So that is so met hing that the the i de ally the the user wo uld cho o se.
Ye ah, so if pe op le a re pro vided with this lon ger con text, then they can bet ter re cover from er rors a long the pi peli ne.
So it is al most pos sib le to fol low the con tent of a talk which is not known to yo u if it is not to o far from the do ma in of the tra i ning of the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system.
Ah, o kay, ye ah .So here is a lit tle sum mary of what has to be do ne.If yo u a re pre sen ting text only in the two li nes of sub tit ling.
So yo u have some ASRs.So this is some English stre am of wor ds.Pi xels on your scre en.At any gi ven mo ment.It is also very fle xib le
ar chi tec tu re of .This is an en ti re bo ok. So yo u se e that the re is no sen ten ce bo un da ri es.And the seg men ter ne eds to pre dict some sen ten ce bo un da ri es.
So it pre dic ted a full stop here and a full stop he re.And then some ASR up da te co mes.And it al so, ba sed on this up da te, the seg men ter has
a not her up da te. So it pre dicts o ne more full stop he re. So this is like se qu en ces of up da tes co ming.And some of the se sen ten ces a re al re ady
com ple ted .So the seg men ter say s:"This full stop is fi nal. I will ne ver ne ver take it back Do with this sen ten ce, wha tever yo u li ke, I will not to uch it ."Then
some of the se some of the se full stops a re still un stab le. So I may will re move this full stop, and I may move it slightly.And then we also have
to like han dle that pro perly.And then yes.And the rest, the last sen ten ce is only ex pec ted or in co ming like we do not know what what the sen ten ce
will fi nish li ke. We a re sen ding now full sen ten ces to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system .So that is the the that is like go od.
That me ans that the empty system fed with the in put is re ady for .So now, go ing into Ger man.It will say like so met hing li ke:
"Pi xeln a uf Ihrem Bil dschirm Zu je dem Za it punkt.Es ist auch eine sehr fle xibe le Archi tec tur.
Also, so this ma kes this ma kes sen se. This is like cor rect Ger man sen ten ces .The is su e is how much spa ce yo u have to show this Ger man to the u ser.
So if we have two li nes of sub tit les, then we wo uld then we wo uld show this yel low part and this yel low part.And then, be ca u se the last sen ten ce got
some ex tra words, tt got ex ten ded, the system de cided to chan ge the be gin ning of of this sen ten ce.It de cided to chan ge the last word
on the first sub tit le li ne.If the line is like still vi sib le we can e a sily do the chan ge.And not hing bad hap pens.If we a re li mited to just o ne line of sub tit le
o ut put, then this line has been al re ady rol led o ut .Li ke the the the the user can no lon ger se e it .The user saw it a se cond a go. But now this is no
lon ger ac ces sib le. So we wo uld have to show the like only half of the sen ten ce, and that is so met hing that we can not do. So the sen ten ce has chan ged.
We call this re set .Now the now the se sub tit ling mec ha nism has to go back and show so met hing which has al re ady scrol led up and show it a ga in
so that the user can re re ad. But this re set is ex tre mely an noy in g.So yo u may have no ticed that so meti mes this the se sub tit les got
red.And the the red ef fect is e xactly hig hlig hting a re set has hap pe ned .So the the seg men ter the seg men ter was os cil la ting like whe re
to put some of the full stops, whe re to put the ah, the ca sing chan ges.And if the chan ge of the full stop or the ca sing hap pe ned a bove the ed ge, in
the line which al re ady rol led up, then the sub tit le, even for here for ASR is su ed a res ted, and it also in di cated in red .So the red for me
was like a re mar k.Yes, this is the red .So this is the this is the case whe re the sub tit les had to scroll back, be ca u se so met hing was up da ted o ut si de of the scre en.
So that, that is an il lus tra ti on why the li mited o ut put spa ce is so cri tical for de live ring the the tran sla ti on to the u ser.
If yo u li mit yo ur self to o much, if the lan gu a ge dif fe ren ce is to o big, and so the word re or de ring and the length of the sen ten ces of like make yo u
redo lar ger bits that then fit on the fi nal scre en, then the user will be ex pe ri en cing very con fu sing re set s.So I 'm like stres sing this be ca u se this
is so met hing this is the se a re de cisi ons that yo u make a long the who le pi peli ne.And it is only the very last bit the size of the win dow that kills it,
or or ma kes it make it wor kab le. So that is that is why we a re like fig hting in the con sor ti um .Li ke what is the bet ter o ut put .The it se ems, ba sed on
the se ar gu ments, that yo u de fini tely do not want to have the se sub tit les .Yo u yo u pre fer yo u yo u sho uld pre fer the lon ger pa rag raph view that that yo u
saw on the pre vi ous sli de. But the prob lem here is that if yo u if yo u make some very bad mis ta ke, if some some bad word of frmo pro fanity ap pe ars
in the o ut put, it will stick the re for to o long.And pe op le like the take o ut the ir cell pho nes and and take pic tu res of that of that bad word.
So ah, yo u a re ex po sing to o much of of your prob lems in this se tup .So that is why that is why the the some some par tners in the con sor ti um pre fer red
the the sub tit les .But the re is a big risk of of the sub tit les be ing in com pre hen sib le. Ok.So then the re is the o verall cog ni tive lo ad, and the the the
o verall u sabi lit y.We have two u sers, they a re he re, who con fir med that .So so sor ry.The re is many that that is a not her the se a re the se he re.
So the re is so many u sers who have tri ed to fol low this have said that the re is no way that yo u wo uld be fol lo wing the tran sla ti on on your no tebo ok
and lo o king at the sli des or the spe a ker, who is in front of yo u. Even if it is like in a very clo se an gle, if yo u do not have to move your eyes to o much,
yo u still have to ac co moda te be ca u se of the dif fe rent dis tan ce, and, that will take some ti me.And then yo u will, as soon as yo u look up at the sli des,
yo u will lose the sub tit les, and yo u will lose con ten t.So we a re now wor king on ad ding the sli des also to the to the scre en whe re the sub tit les
ap pe ar, or the ot her way a ro und put ting sub tit les to the to the scre en, whe re the sli des a re. So this is so met hing which which has to be do ne.
And then the o verall u sabi lit y.The o verall u sabi lity is still very bad.I'm in vi ting yo u who e ver does not spe ak French, and wo uld like to join us.
We a re, ho pefully this we ek, we a re run ning like a French mo vi e wat ching ses si on, or just ten mi nutes of a TED tal k.We do not spe ak French.
So we will fol low o ur systems, re cog ni zing the French and tran sla ting into English, or or check or any ot her lan gu a ge.And it will try to come up
with im pro vements that wo uld make it ac tu ally u sab le. Be ca u se it is very big dif fe ren ce, whet her yo u can un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge, or or not.
Our, we had a si milar ses si on with Mar tin Po pel pre sen ting so met hing on mac hi ne tran sla ti on e valu a ti on in Czech and it was ad den ded by o ur two
fo re ign stu dents.And the se two fo re ign stu dents re por ted that they co uld fol low the Czeck talk, if they fully fo cused on the pa rag raph vi ew. And then
as soon as they lo o ked upon the sli des, they got los t.So if with full at ten ti on to the sli des, it was pos sib le to fol low it.
But this is not for nor mal u ser s.Li ke nor mal u sers have to have to have some free time for the ir for the ir bra ins as well.
I wo uld like to hig hlight that the de sired set ting dif fers from user to u ser .Tho se who un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge will need the si mul ta ne itly,
and they will pre fer it over pre cisi on and sta bility.If yo u a re fol lo wing what I 'm say ing, then and if yo u a re re a ding the sub tit les in your mot her
ton gu e, then they co uld pro vide yo u with the words that yo u mis sed.If yo u do not un der stand a word it co uld ap pe ar he re, yo u wo uld un der stand it.
But it has to ap pe ar here at the like on the spot, at at the mo ment, when I said the word.If it is the re thre e se conds af ter, then yo u, it was of no
u se to yo u an ymo re. Be ca u se yeah like yo u have mo ved in what yo u a re lis te ning al re ad y.So if yo u a re fol lo wing the so ur ce lan gu a ge, the sub tit les in
your mot her ton gu e can help yo u, but they have to be im me di a te.If yo u do not un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge, then yo u a re only rel ying on the text.
And in that ca se, yo u wo uld pre fer stab li lity and pre cisi on And yo u a re happy to wait for se conds. Yo u yo u do not know what I 'm tal king a bo ut at all.
So it is not a prob lem if if yo u get my mes sa ge e ight se conds la ter. So this is two very dif fe rent u se ca ses. And it sho uld be the user to se lect
which which of the dis plays is is the re not not us.OK so e valu a ti on .The re a re thre e as pects of spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on .Qu a lity, that is so met hing
that we know from mac hi ne tran sla ti on.And we know how to have va gu ely es ti mate the tran sla ti on qu a lit y.But the re is also the lag.
How much is the text in the tran sla ti on de lay ed be hind the so ur ce. So me of the lag is ob vi ously i nevi tab le, be ca u se yo u have to wait for the Ger man
verb, or we have to an ti cipa te it in some way.And the re is flick er .So if yo u have a system which is up da ting, and we have such systems, then the se
systems can an ti cipa te, and they have the ca pacity to co ring them sel ves .So then sud denly they can cre a te some o ut put, and then re move it in the next
step.And this has to be con trol led very much so that the user is not con fu sed .So we a re wor king on an e volu ti on tool with E bra him Ansa ri.And here is just the the the most se ri ous prob lem.
If yo u have this English ASR.Do yo u know it is a cat.Isn't it .Yes it is like that .So let us i magi ne that the seg men ter has seg men ted it into the se
two chun ks.The re is no way to a lign it well with this Ger man tran sla ti on re feren ce, be ca u se it has thre e sen ten ces that they the words a re gro u ped in
a dif fe rent way in the sen ten ces .So we have to so mehow for ce a lign the se so that the ba sic set of u nits that we a re e valu a ting over is com mon to all systems, re gar dless of what the English ASR do es.Uh, e ver ybody has to re ach the
same re feren ce seg men ta ti on .So the re is some stra tegi es.I'm not go ing into the into the de ta ils, any mo re. Essen ti ally, we have e it her the op ti on to
work with the se sen ten ces, like con si der more sen ten ces at the same ti me, or we can to tally for get sen ten ces, and we can e valu a te by e valu a ting
30 se conds chun ks.So did the the MT, the SLT pi peli ne, the SLT pi peli ne pro duce the right words wit hin the se 30 se conds?
And if it did then, yes, if not then not .So this is this is like a way to go a ro und the prob lems of sen ten ces not be ing ut te red in in spe ech
at al l.Ye ah .So the sur ge, or the mo bili zati on, as I as I say it .The bat tle to wards a u sab le system is still not los t.So we a re now bu il ding of an
army of paid vo lun te ers.And if yo u have any col le a gu es or stu dents who can help us bet we en now and May or Ju ne, we a re to tally happy to take them
on bo ar d.We a re me e ting at le ast once a week for just 30 mi nutes and dis cus sing who is wor king on what.And we have funds for this.
So this is li ke, ehm, a paid work And yo u can do many smal lish tas ks.For e xam ple, if yo u a re lo o king at some of the MT o ut puts,
the re co uld have been bad cha rac ters, be ca u se no o ne has yet flag ged check ed whe re they come from in the pi peli ne. Then the re is lar ger
things that we need to de velop .We wo uld like to have a a das hbo ard, which we will give a con fi gura ti on like a life system run ning, which grows logs, log fi les and this das hbo ard sho uld al low us to im me di a tely se e whe re is a prob lem.
So for e xam ple, if we a re re cog ni zing the English bo oth with the French ASR, then the re will be many French words co ming from the systems, but they
will be to tally wron g.That is the the most la ug hab le o ut put I have seen so far. Li ke swap ping the lan gu a ges for the ASR be ca u se the the systems
will strug gle.It will be like words si milar with pro nun ci a ti on, but in the wrong lan gu a ge, and the sen ten ces won't make any sen se what so e ver.
So this can e a sily hap pen.If yo u a re fol lo wing six in puts and tran sla ting into 43 lan gu a ges, yo u need a con ci se view to to to know what your systems
a re do in g.So that wo uld be a das hbo ar d.Then a lot of work on the do ma in and spe a ker a dap ta ti on .Just just get ting in to uch with all the in ter pre ters tho se who will be in the bo oth and con tac ting them, as king them to come here re cord an hour e ach.
And then u sing this data to a dapt the system .Aga in.A lot of a lot of lit tle wor k.Co de swit ching is so met hing which I have not dis cus sed
in my talk at al l.But I'm re a lizing how fre qu ent it is, not only in lin gu is tic lec tu res, whe re we have e xam ples in fo re ign lan gu a ges
But also na tive spe a kers of ot her lan gu a ges than English fre qu ently bring in English phra ses, and the ASR systems a re to tally not re ady for that.
So then the, it is very si milar to to the na med ex pres si on or na med en ti ti es.It is simply un known words that get re cog ni zed into so met hing very, very bad.
And then when this gets tran sla ted, it is very very la ug hab le. The re is also a not her ac ti vity, which wo uld re ally like to start call in le at her
clim bin g.So it is when yo u have fi xed test set, and yo u a re wor king on im pro vements of your mo del, er, or the pi peli ne. So yo u' re ma king many small chan ges.
And yo u a re al ways e valu a ting on the test set .So yo u a re clim bing the le at her of per for man ce. So this is this is what we have to run.
I'm ho ping for like two big ger mo del ret ra i nings un til un til May and many ar chi tec tu ral chan ges, many like smal ler fi xes that can im pro ve
the sco re qu i te a bit .And.Yep .I've al re ady tal ked a bo ut this this das hbo ar d.But this is still so met hing dif fe ren t.The das hbo rad is like tec hni cal, uh, set up.
Yo u want to know that the so und vo lume from all the six in puts is the rig ht.With this mul ti so ur ce mo nitor, yo u as su me that the,
tec hni cally, the ar chi tec tu re is all set up well, but still, yo u need to de cide which of the ASR in the com bi nati on with the spe a ker works best,
and which of the se so ur ces de livers the best tran sla ti on qu a lity into the many tar get lan gu a ges .So this is like a tec hni cal check that e ver ything is
run ning. And this is se lec ti on of the best path thro ugh the, for the best o ut put qu a lit y.Ye ah .To sum ma rize. ELITR sub tit ling, er, a is a big
chal len ge for the pro ject Even if yo u con nect to su per hu man com po nents, they can still de liver crap to get her.
So we a re now wor king on ma king this u sab le. Tec hni cally, the com plex pi peli ne now works.It has been wor kin g...How many res tarts did yo u have to, er, do, San ge et? Mul tip le?
Ye ah .Okay .So it is not se am les s.But with o ne o pera tor, it can sur vi ve 60 mi nutes of of spe ech, an d...But un for tu nately, even with this who le system wor king, the be nefit for the end user is still li mited or no nexis tent.
So.If yo u did not fol low my English spe ech, if yo u only had a chan ce to read the Czech tran sla ti on, I'm cu ri ous how much yo u wo uld get.
So this is o ne of the. ..We a re. ..We have still a few months to go. So I'm I'm very lucky that that we have the se months to to fix the pi peli ne.
And some of the prob lems that we a re run ning into a re not go ing to be sol ved in the next two, thre e, five ye ars.
But some of them can be fi xed So we will do o ur best to to make the the the o ut put ac tu ally u sab le.
And ye ah .Ple a se. Ple a se join us.
Ah, be ca u se ah, ye ah .Wit h.That's it .So we have a tec hno logy, which tec hni cally works but it is to tally u nusab le.
And and I'm cu ri ous, how how far we get in in the se mon ths.So we a re run ning this this army or this this mo bili zati on.
So we seek for your help and just talk to any of us .So may be tho se of yo u who a re al re ady on the sur ge te am, just ra i se your hands
so that pe op le se e One, two, thre e. Ah.Ye ah .Atul .So at le ast four four pe op le in the room al re ady.And if yo u have mo re...Or
if yo u have stu dents who wo uld like to get in to uch with this .This is a nice    it is not sum mer in ter nship    it is like spring, spring in ter nship.
Ple a se, ple a se, let them know.And yo u can read all the de ta ils a bo ut the pro ject in the blog.And if yo u want the the real truth, then talk to us
di rec tly.Ye ah, OK.Thank yo u. Thank yo u very much for...And I think we still have some mi nutes to ask qu es ti ons or add some de ta il s.Ye ah .Han ka.
Well, yo u spo ke a bo ut the the the prob lem from ASR.If the re is a mis ta ke in un der stan ding of the of the word then it brings the prob lem
fur ther to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on.And yo u also spo ke a bo ut the the mo dule, that puts the pun ctu a ti on into into the ste am of words.
Did yo u con si der some so met hing, like hm some sort of gram mar check er, or some lan gu a ge mo del that wo uld check whet her the sup po sed sen ten ces
a re re ally sen ten ces or dra mati cally good e no ugh to be sent to mac hi ne tran sla ti on .So yes, and no. The who le pun ctu a ti on in ser ti on,
the seg men ter is a lan gu a ge mo del as suc h.So that is that is just like n gram ba sed .But it is not n gram.It is it is lon ger se qu en ces.
It is a ne u ral net work ba sed lan gu a ge mo del.And it is tra i ned on con ca tena ted sen ten ces .But I think the se sen ten ces a re con ca tena ted
from al re ady a shuf fled tra i ning set .So it has ...Li ke. ...The sen ten ces came be came ad ja cent just by ran dom ness, and not by a pro per con text.
So the re is a cer ta in li mita ti on .So that is that is the yes part of of that .So it to tally re li es on some lan gu a ge mo del in the sta tis ti cal
sen se mo re.And some gram ma tica lity of the sen ten ces ?No, no. We a re not con si dering that at all, be ca u se, well, we also do not as su me that pe op le
wo uld ut ter gram ma tically cor rect sen ten ces .So that is the um the the, prob lem, or the task that yo u may be re fer ring to wo uld be cal led spe ech
re con struc ti on.And this is so met hing that that o ur de par tment has been wor king on in the past as wel l.The re the goal is to take the partly
dis flu ency spe ech of of myself and con vert it into a writ ten li ke spe ec h.Li ke pro per all, only all cor rect, gram ma tically pro per sen ten ces.
But we a re not wor king with with this com po nent at all in in o ur system .So qu i te on the con trary, we a re rat her mo ving to wards mac hi ne
tran sla ti on systems, which will be ro bust to tran sla ting even the se a par ti al sen ten ces .So, I have not men ti o ned in the sli des, but a not her of
stu dents of mi ne, Do minik Mac háček, is wor king on on mac hi ne tran sla ti on, which runs not on sen ten ces, but on a win dow of words.
So we wo uld like to get rid of the seg men ter al to get her.And we wo uld, ho pefully, if if we' re pro vided with good tra i ning data that has this
pro perty, then the tran sla ti on system wo uld be able to tran sla te dis flu ent sen ten ces into dis flu ent sen ten ces u sab le in the tar get lan gu a ge.
Mo re qu es ti ons?OK.I have the qu es ti on a bo ut the is su e of whe re to pla ce your mic rop ho ne, be ca u se se veral ti mes, I saw some spe a kers hol ding the ir mic rop ho ne
un der the ir chin, like this .Ha ve yo u ever seen it?It's not fre qu ent at all that they 're cla i ming that it's it 's...Yo u can...
It is com ple tely un der stan dab le.And yo u pre vent flo wing the a ir .We have not tri ed .So next next time yo u se e me gi ving a talk,
I'll be su rely hol ding a mic rop ho ne un der my chin to e valu a te it pro perly.I re a lize that the re is no loud spe a kers here in the ro om.
But when yo u put the mic rop ho ne un der your chin your vo i ce has chan ged here in like in the in the loud in the in the wil d.Ye ah.
So I do not know, may be may be the re cor ding has not has not seen any chan ge, but we ha ve.OK.I have two small qu es ti on s.One qu es ti on con cerns or,
it is a re mar k.That I think that if in to nati on is paid du e at ten ti on to, then it might help for the seg men ta ti on a lot.
Of co ur se, in the flu ent spe ech, pe op le don't be have ac cor ding to the ru les .That stil l.But I have o ne qu es ti on for your sli de num ber 43.
I just won de red .Ye ah .The re a re bet we en...In the 34 part yo u have ca pitals but yo u don't have pun ctu a ti on.I think this is bugs.Ok.
So, so we do not know.I do not know ...We can ac tu ally give it a try.If I la unch this .But whe re whe re is this that ?So. So he re. tiny So I will I will...
I will stop the live sub tit les, be ca u se it is pick ing...Or I'll le a ve them on.I am pretty happy with your an swer .So. So I'm I'm cu ri ous myself be ca u se here is the whe re is that....
Be ca u se I have o ne more ge neral qu es ti on .Ye ah .Ye ah .So ple a se, feel free to ask.I will just go to the pa rag raph view in the me an ti me.
So let us switch off the Hin di and Hun ga ri an.And and X1 and X0.So this is my English re cog ni zed, and it is be ing tran sla ted into Ger man, and into Czech.
Ye ah.And and the more ge neral qu es ti on, which may be yo u have he ard se ven ti mes .How much can yo u le arn or add to your con si dera ti ons if yo u ask the tran sla tors...
Inter pre ter s...Inter pre ter s...Inter pre ters who have the si mul ta ne ous tran sla ti on ...From the ir stra tegi es or so met hing like that...
Is the re so met hing in the in the system, which wo uld ref lect this ex pe ri en ce? Not yet.
Not at al l.We a re in to uch with them, be ca u se yo u like it, it helps us.
So we, we. ..Thanks to them we can get hold of the da ta, but the ir in ter pre tati on stra tegi es a re much more much more long ran ge, so, to say.
So, they a re happy to lis ten to a co up le of sen ten ces, even for the si mul ta ne ous tran sla ti on So si mul ta ne ous can still mean 20 se conds af ter that.
And they will first get the who le i de a.And they, they will spe ak it from scratch.
And this is very dis tant from what we a re do ing, but we a re a i ming to get into the same re alm, so to say.
So we have now o ur very first data sets whe re we have the so ur ce spe ech in English, which is be ing in ter pre ted live into Czech by some of the se stu dents.
And so we a re also tran scri bing the English.And we a re tran sla ting in the text form what was said in English.
And the e valu a ti on tool that I men ti o ned that will con si der the qu a lity in terms of BLEU sco re or a si milar sco re for mac hi ne tran sla ti on, the lag and the flick er, is me ant    it is not yet tes ted    but it is me ant to be ap pli cab le also to hu man in ter pre ters.
So i de ally, we wo uld se e that the hu man in ter pre ters a re much bet ter in pre cisi on, or the the qu a lity of the o ut put, but they will be much slo wer.
They will have much lon ger lags.And they will ob vi ously have no flick ers or very li kely they wil l...Well, it will be dif fi cult to spot the flick ers, be ca u se the the the way will be col lec ting the da ta.
So. But we wo uld re ally like to have a u toma ted tool that e valu a tes both SLT systems and in ter pre ters in in the same thre e sca les.
And then we se e what a re the com ple men tary be nefits of of the se like gro ups of of pro ces sors.
The ir stra tegi es so far a re a re not of any u se to us.
And also the ir e valu a ti on stra tegi es a re very dis tant from what we a re like tal king a bo ut.
So that that ...Ye ah .We have seen a chec klist of when they a re be ing gra ded, the in ter pre ters.And an d..Ye ah So me of the se i tems a re a re to tally ir re levant to o ur tec hno logy.
Ok. Thank yo u.
So I am af ra id we have to stop at this po int.
   
So thank yo u a ga in for your talk.
And I just wo uld like to an no un ce that we don't have a ses si on next we ek.
And yo u will le arn a bo ut the tit le, and the spe a ker of the next fol lo wing week in your e ma ils.
So thank yo u very much.
Thank yo u.
