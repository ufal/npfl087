This is fully o ver lo a ded.
Okay.
Yo u that is.
So let me wel co me yo u.
And the first ses si on of the spring tur ned off se ven, not a o ne to se ven.
And it is my ple a sure to come he re, o ne off of a car we eks.
It will fall.
And I 'm re ally e a ger to know what well what e ver ything can go wrong in life spe ech, so unds sta ti on.
So the flo or.
The Ce o 's.
Thank yo u for the in te rac ti on.
Well, I 'm af ra id that he will in de ed se e it li fe.
So so now this is a sum mary of the cur rent sta tus of the e lite, the pro ject whe re we a re trying to do life sup pli ed link into many tar get lan gu a ges, and I will bri efly des cri be how that works.
Well, give it o ne more trying.
If the re is an ything ap pe a ring, no does not se em.
So, Oh, yes, the re is so met hing is hap pe ning.
So it is may be may be at the bot tom of the scre en.
The re will be the only sub tit les of what I 'm say ing," it is to tally not cer ta in that it can be many flaws in tho se in tho se do not scripts and de libe rately were not sho wing that tran sla ti on, be ca u se the tran sla ti on has hard time in fe e ding into the se two li nes.
But if yo u have a, but if yo u have to yo u your mac hi nes e ar, no bo oks, or or may be even cell pho nes with yo u.
The re is a sha red Go og le look hu man, which yo u pro bably know from pre vi ous Mon day Se minars, and the re is two links whe re yo u can se e also the tran sla ti ons, not only in the tran scripts, and yo u can cho o se the tar get lan gu a ges.
I be li e ve Hin di, is also a mong also a mong the tar get lan gu a ges.
So the re will be u se some in ten ti on jo kes du ring the pre sen ta ti on, and the re will be many u nin ten ti o nal ones in the sub tit les.
Ple a se do not la ugh to o lo ud.
We we know what is a peer Inc, the re.
But that is that is life that is work in prog ress.
So to day.
I wo uld like to bri efly dis cuss the dif fe ren ces bet we en mis si on physi ci ans po ker in which tran sla ti on.
And then o ur sum ma rize the am bi ti on that o ur pro ject has ah, a inch, be ca u se the am bi ti on is is high.
We know it.
We a re on a num ber of tests ses si ons.
And this is ac tu ally o ne of the test ses si ons as well.
So af ter the sum mary of the test ses si ons that that we a re ta king part in.
I will bri efly sum ma rize the old ar chi tec tu re.
And then I will go a long all the pos sib le is su es of all the e ver ything that can go wrong.
And that is why the re is a long long list of things that that can go wrong.
And luck ily, things to the num ber of in ver si ons that we a re trying this list of er rors.
It is is so low on the er rors that res pond on.
Every new si milar in stan ce, is is not gro wing much.
So we still have the er rors.
But luck ily, we a re clo se to se eing the known er rors, which we have some ways, at le ast, in some ca ses, we which we have some ways to fix o kay, and then will sum ma rize and lo cal di rec ti on this.
So a ga in, down yo ur.
So it wo uld come e arly de man ded tests.
That is whe re yo u can se e the sub tit les.
Okay, ah, we have been wor king.
We as the De par tment have been wor king on mac hi ne tran sla ti on, for many ye ars, or de cays ac tu ally, a in 't it.
When yo u say mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
We might mean text tran sla ti on.
And the re the im port a re sen ten ces, which a re, which a re al most al ways gram ma tically," cor rect, and they may come in do cuments.
So yo u may have some con tent, some con text sur ro un ding the sen ten ces, or yo u might also so meti mes by sen ten ce.
But it is de fini tely like so meti mes ba sed in spo ken English tran sla ti on.
The in put is so und.
And the o ut put is text.
We will get to some more de ta ils a bo ut.
What does this text, but sen ten ces, some may or may not be pro duce, then ac tu ally them so meti mes sho uld not be as su med at all.
So may be what we all know that we do not spe ak in sen ten ces and fi guring o ut whe re the sen ten ce.
And this is a dif fi cult part.
So that is the re.
The re will be some pen si on.
When when my put ting the se two com po nents to get her, the spe ech re cog ni ti on and the mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
And the re is o ne more area that I wo uld like to just men ti on is cal led" in cre men tal mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
And the re, this is mac hi ne tran sla ti on, the re se ar chers do ing that.
So they start with the words words that come in sen ten ces, and they just feed the system with the words, but o ne at ti me.
So the in cre men tal mis si ons.
Oppo siti on is still to at le ast to my know led ge to my un der stan ding is still ta kes the base tran sla ti on.
It just co mes a ward at ti me.
And the re is dif fe rent from the spe ech, which co mes a se cond a di me, like a a bit of so und at a ti me, so that the time is dif fe rent.
Even if we even if we go for some in cre men tal do ing.
Okay?
So this is in pic tu res, the am bi ti on, or the the sum mary of the two tec hno logi es that a re e xami ned bar by o ur pro ject.
We a re trying to put to put to get her spe ech re cog ni ti on and mac hi ne tran sla ti on into spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on.
He re, some his tory of ah, the spe ech re cog ni ti on, but we have not re ally as de par tment.
We have not re ally work on spe ech re cog ni ti on.
So will I just copy this from from so mew he re.
And it se ems that the only from the e ig hti es pe op le run many sha re tasks and im pro ve the the per for man ce of of the re cog ni ti on.
And here a ro und two to four per cent off word er ror ra te.
That is whe re hu mans a re not with the pre cisi on and on the E.
In e arly days.
In 1990, so met hing some systems got to the hu man per for man ce, and then on con ver sa ti o nal spe ech, which is like un li mited is un li mited spe ech or me e tings pe op le.
The systems a re far from this from this ben chmark, but then has been chan ging, or the last two ye ars thanks to the ne u ral net works.
So this i mage more con ver sa ti o nal spe ech, the ben chmark that is 40 for the calls bet we en two ran dom English spe a kers the re.
The hu man le vel of six per cent has been kind of re ac hing two do zen 17.
So that se ems like that spe ech re cog ni ti on.
If it is the right thing.
It can work e qu ally us e qu ally well us as hu mans do.
Then this is the the the his tory of mac hi ne tran sla ti on into check that yo u know, from pre vi ous pre sen ta ti ons off from Mar tin Po pe, well, and also then from me.
This is o ur systems.
And the last o ne is the Su per Hu man mac hi ne tran sla ti on system from English into check into does not 18.
Mar tin spa pe arls set up was able to, yo u know, to o ut per form hu man tran sla tors like pro fes si o nal tran sla tors be lit tles Balk tran sla ti on.
It was they.
They did not pay more at ten ti on to that, then the then look to the ir nor mal job.
So that was like the the a vera ge pro fes si o nal tran sla ti on qu a lity inch ever lo o ted sen ten ce by sen ten ce.
Uh, the set up by Mar tin Pa pa was was sig ni ficantly bet ter than that.
Obvi ously, the re is many ca ve ats to uh, to uh, take into ac co unt.
But that is the that is the set ting.
Yo u have two tec hno logi es.
Yo u have spo ken English tran sla ti on, which co uld be on par with hu mans, and yo u have mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
Uh.
So, so we have the the spe ech re cog ni ti on, which co uld be on par with the hu mans and mac hi ne tran sla ti on, which co uld be on par with hu mans.
So that is whe re we sa id," let us join them.
Let us.
Let us get this.
Let us make u se of this of the se gre at to ac hi e vements.
Let us put them to get her.
So in o ur pro ject to the L E.
The pro ject.
We a re trying to.
This will be badly miss re cog ni ze the be ca u se it does not re cog ni ze and the and the na mes of will sell in in the uh, the the pro ject that we a re put ting to get her spe ech re cog ni ti on and mac hi ne tran sla ti on in highly mul ti lin gu al set ting I will men ti on that la ter on.
Well, we a re Cor de li a Pro ject, the Uni ver sity of, but Edin burgh, in clu ding us, a re ex perts in mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
So to say cal led thro ugh his ex pert in inch spe ech re cog ni ti on.
We have the top per for ming systems.
If we put them to get her.
I 'm sure it will work.
Gre at and pa ir wi se is an Ita li an com pany.
They have also been in vol ved in num ber of Eu rope an pro jects be fore, and they were al ways in the role of the in teg ra tor.
So they know how to put things to get her, and they have some ba seli ne systems that we can bu ild up on.
And then we have a user par tner all for yo u, which is re mote con fe ren cing system whe re we wo uld like to tran sla te what pe op le do what pe op le say in the in in the re mote calls and Hiv and ot her user par tner.
And the re is the sup re am a u dit of fi ce of the Czech Re pub lic.
And.
The Sup re me Au dit Offi ce.
They a re to o af ra id of of do ing an ything bad with with fi nan cing.
So did they did not want to get sin gle Eu ro.
So they a re not part of the pro ject, but they a re just then a few lady, yo u the par tner.
So they a re not sup por ted by the Eu rope an com mis si on.
Uh, o kay.
So the am bi ti on.
The am bi ti on is is very big.
We want to sup port a Con gress that the Sup re me a u dit of fi ce.
Runs this ye ar.
In the end of may or e arly Ju ne, and the par ti cipants of that Con gress come from many co un tri es, and in so me, they spe ak 43 lan gu a ges.
So this is well bey ond the ca pacity of a us off si mul ta ne ous in ter pre ting by hu mans, and we want to pro vide the mis sing lan gu a ges.
So to say, so, the re will be six lan gu a ges spo ken at that.
Con gress.
So English and French and Spa nish Ger man, Rus si an and check.
The se a re the of fi ci al lan gu a ges of the Con gress.
This will be ma nu ally in ter pre ted ac ross so that all the six a re pro vided, and we a re to pro vide the re ma i ning 43 ot her.
The the re ma i ning that the rest of the 43 lan gu a ges.
So this set off, yo u a re sel ling, which is lar ger than this, ar ti fici ally yo u lan gu a ges.
And that is also an im por tant re mark, be ca u se many of the se lan gu a ges a re much world as much shor ter off of da ta.
So the Eu rope an com mis si on.
So the Eu rope an Uni on has al re ady put a con si derab le for ce into a da te.
Our so ur ce is the for some ye ars.
Ever ything from the Eu rope an Par li a ment was tran sla ted into all the lan gu a ges.
All the do cuments of the Eu rope an Uni on a re a va i lab le in all the lan gu a ges.
So we have so met hing to tra in on be fore the stand for lan gu a ges, but less soul for this 19 Edi son lan gu a ges.
And some of the se lan gu a ges have even so a brand new or un cle ar stay ed, as they had no gram mar.
Bo oks were writ ten for them yet.
So that is that is a chal len ge on its own.
Okay.
Ye ah, so the e vents.
We know that this all sho uld run.
So we have al re ady star ted.
The pro ject star ted last year in Ja nu ary, and in March.
We have ad ded o ne ex tra dry run.
So in o ur pro ject plan we ha ve.
We had like two dry run ses si ons.
And then the Con gress.
And we sa id," well, on the third at tempt to do e ver ything.
Well, so that as the 200 De lega tes, or 400.
If yo u come the de lega te and the ir and the ir fel low that the 400 pe op le will se e what what we have tes ted just two eyes be fore hand.
That is im pos sib le.
So we have ad ded num ber of a num ber of ot her e vents.
The first o ne.
What hap pe ned in March.
Last ye ar.
It was the stu dent fare of fa ke, ther mos li ke mock mock bu siness com pa ni es.
And the re we were tes ting the al tar and Pre e xis ting tec hno logy wo uld ca u se to a he ad. And what per was he ard,
and we just did o ur mac hi ne tran sla ti on system from English in ter ject then that we also got in to uch with the as I do not know the go od, the cor rect English name of the de par tment, but the De par tment for in ter pre ting in tran sla ti on and the fa culty of arts of o ur u niver sity.
And thanks to the ir sup port. We a re able to at the end. The re. Mo re con fe ren ces were the in ter pre ters a re get ting tra in.
And we a re re cor ding the small pe op le in ter pre ters, and as the li kes of se eing what o ur systems can do with that mul tip le in puts.
So this is this is like si milar set ting whe re the re is in the ir brot hers in the wars, and we a re trying to fol low what they a re say ing and com pli men ted with the with the ot her lan gu a ges.
And then we had the two of fi ci al e vents that a re plan ned for o ur uh, for pro ject, that o ne was a wor king gro up on va lu e, ad ded tax, which hap pe ned in Ju ne,
and then right af ter the sum mer in Octo ber. The re was a not her me e ting.
So the se two e vents were like qu i te clo se to each ot her,
not so not much. The de velop ment was pos sib le bet we en the se two e vents.
And then in No vem ber, we also ad ded o ne more
was sho wing this tec hno logy in a lit tle demo on the month is open do ors. They. And I was also trying to pre sent it at best of proxy AI e vent and.
Then in Feb ru ary, so, very simply it. We. Had wor kshop, a dry run of wor kshop, which will also go run at the Con gress.
And the re the pur po se of the wor kshop is to de mon stra te not only mac hi ne tran sla ti on, but all ot her text pro ces sing or an o pi a te tec hno logi es to the a u di en ce to the lady u sers. The Sup re me o rators. It is is to il lus tra te how all the and Lp to ols can help them in the ir bu siness.
And we a re go ing to run this wor kshop, ob vi ously in English, and the re will be the lan gu a ge bar ri ers. So the the o rators wo uld like to se e some tran sla ti ons of of that.
So the suc ces sful a demo was only in No vem ber,
this was the big fa i lure, be ca u se they the wi fe. I did not start.
Well, no men ti on that la ter on.
And then the the the long, clo se wor kshop.
Ever ything wor ked well, but it was ac tu ally still pretty u seless for the u sers.
And and ho pefully yo u will se e in the fol lo wing sli des. Why this is the ca se.
This is the up co ming e vents.
The re is a ga me. So the more con fe ren ce is af fec ted of ours
will a ga in for to se e them.
The re is a not her in stan ce, of the stu dent firms fa ir. We a re a ga in, trying to uh, to get to that, be ca u se the size of the high scho ol stu dents have from ac ross the Eu rope, pro vide be au tifully non na tive spe ech.
So they a re very hard to uh, to un der stand for the ears a re system.
So we. We get the test sets the re. And Jo e. We a re ma king it. A sha red a re still to un der stand the se high scho ol stu dents,
then yes. So uh, this is the this is the sha re task whe re we a re trying to get also ot her Re se arch Insti tute sto od to the pro cess that data that the high scho ol stu dents.
And then we will have a se cond run of all wor kshop.
May be we will add some ot her things.
And the main e vent is e arly Ju ne in here in Pra gu e, and they a re all them on this.
I me an, the re is so a ga in, and e very Mon day si milar, yo u will have a chan ce to to se e sub tit les.
Ok.
So here is a very bri ef re por ted on last March e vent.
The stu dent firms fa ir.
The re was o ne spe a ker also with that we a re.
We a re like we.
We put the Mi ke to not only the stu dents.
The much sa id," lod ging the check Gm is e cono mist.
And yo u se e that it is the the the old system wor ked pretty well, in clu ding o ur check tran sla ti ons.
So he was spe a king, and it was re cog ni zing him.
It was re cog ni zing sen ten ces.
So for a bo ut mi nute, we have the per fect show.
And that was it from thre e days.
We had like o ne mi nute.
So what we star ted blog ging.
And and we we block a bo ut all o ur suc ces ses.
The on o ur Web Pa ge.
Blog ging is fun, and so on so on.
So with blog ging.
Yo u im me di a tely feel fa mo us.
It does not re ally mat ter.
If any o ne fol lows yo u, just the fact that yo u pos ted so mew he re that
that ma kes yo u feel fa mo us, and yo u can also so meti mes im pro ve the re ally to have it.
So the the uh, well, we do not do for a shop ping of o ur.
Most of the only thing is what we do is we se lec ted the ba tes.
The word" wor ked" so have from tho se to day e vents.
It was o ne mi nute, and but we a re go ing to big ger.
So so ho pefully the re will be al most al most 50 mi nutes of to day, which will be sub tit led" Thro ug ho ut the who le ses si on.
So I said that the be gin ning as a re an empty.
The se a re per fect tec hno logi es.
They work we re.
Well, they a re su per hu man.
Yo u just plug them to get her.
Well, it is not qu i te like that to o.
Yo u still need to ac qu i re the so und to, yo u need to get the in put, and yo u need to pri son, the o ut put.
And the re is also the lit ter clash.
The spe ech took me to re cog ni ze his words, but we a re re ady to tran sla te sen ten ces.
So what yo u need to do is yo u need to seg ment.
That is thre e more for it is into sen ten ces.
And then only then yo u can tran sla te them
so that ac tu ally that ac tu ally still re qu i res yo u to to add o ne more com po nents, some some seg men ter seg men ta ti on wor ker, and yo u also need to ship all the se bits of tho se thre e him to the va ri ous wor kers a long the pi peli ne.
So the the two stem, just put the two steps to get her set up.
This is ac tu ally this this com pli cated.
So this is the or ar chi tec tu re.
It is bu ilds upon so met hing which her was de velo ped in in the pre vi ous pro ject.
It is cal led the pa radi se plat form.
And to the se com po nents, all the se com po nents of spe ech re cog ni ti on, and all all that con nects to the cen tral po int call the me di a tor, and yo u have a cli ent
that climb co mics to that me di a tor
the muddy, the ir ships it.
So the a ce a re then to seg ment sen ten ce, seg men ter den tal mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
And then to pre sen ta ti on
in the pre sen ta ti on de livers it to the vet
and have we just re ce i ve like con fir ma ti on that this sin gle word.
This se cond of so und was pro cess the a long the who le pi peli ne
so this.
And this is the runs ac ross the Eu rope.
So some of the se com po nents on here in this bu il ding.
So me of them run so mew he re in the clo ud of pa ir wi se.
So me run in Edin burgh, some run ning cars thro ugh it.
So that is is is this thro ugh be auty
to the con nec ti ons a re al ways o pen, and the re u se ac ross the cli ents a bo ut it thro ugh a re uses o ne par tic le type of Inter net com mu nica ti on that the se Cp pro tocol.
And that re qu i res that the net work is is very bro ad in in the con nec ti on.
So that it.
It does not go col lect any de lay.
Any like this is the set up. That also in clu des the wi ring.
So yo u need to like cal ling the the mac hi nes that the mic rop ho nes and and cun ning, the pri son, think system to the scre en, and all that.
And this is the set of for the year cycle grows whe re the re is six in ter pret this bo oth in all the Mary is on the many sick to all the six lan gu a ges that tho ugh that hu mans in ter pret in to.
And the re we a re col lec ting all tho se then and cho o sing which o ne of them to tran sla te from and then tran sla te to all the re ma i ning 30, so met hing lan gu a ges.
So the set of this a re com pli cated.
This is the wor kers con nec ted to the me di a plat form, and yo u se e that some of them a re busy and some of them a re a va i lab le.
So this, this is like a big in fras truc tu re.
So let us start with some of the is su es
ob vi ously the net work and slow things down.
So once we face is the fact that in Con sul whe re the re was some con struc ti on or wha tever.
For some re a son, the Uni ver sity had lit tle slo wer Inter net ac cess
and that de lay ed all o ur pro ces sing.
So lit tle im me di a tely, we were not li ve.
But we were like se cond sword, do zens of se cond tho ughts la ter than the sig nal.
So yo u yo u sho uld be ac tu ally on sta ge or it very clo se to the ve nu e.
If yo u want to de liver so mew hat in the spe ech re li ably
for debts that this is not prob lem.
But if yo u wan ted to do it life yo u yo u.
Yo u sho uld not rely on on the Inter net.
And this was the prob lem.
And the best of Frock AI, is ses si on whe re I have tes ted e ver ything
it .Wor ked per fectly for the de mo.
Uh, un for tu nately, even like I have lost a month be fore hand.
And then for se cond ti me, I was not al lo wed to con duct my mac hi ne to ol.
Wi red con nec ti on.
I had to rely on why fight.
And e ver ything wor ked twi ce when was at the ve nu e at this that it.
Then the a u di en ce came and the a u di en ce bro ad the ir cell pho nes.
No body ac tu ally u se the Inter net.
The the cell pho nes were just trying to like look a ro und is the re any in ter nal a va i lab le, and they tri ed to con nect.
And and may be just the se tests simply kill the wi fe.
Why? And it did not work for me, and also
on not hing was ever re cog ni zed that even for me.
So.
So we must not rely on wire wi reless con nec ti on.
Then we also had is su es whe re e ver ything went well, ex cept the the the the fi nal pre sen ta ti on was like of fil ling buf fers off web brow sers.
So.
It was not sho wing pro perly on the end user de vice.
It is e ver ything was OK un til the fi nal pre sen ta ti on po int.
And.
This is a not her.
This is like miss con fi gura ti on ever like if your jug gling with with the set up.
So it is easy to make mis ta ke.
So in o ne of the ses si ons.
We were ob ser ving some hor rib le.
The lady ga i ning a re gro wing.
And the re a son was that we a re in o ur own so lar system, be ca u se we a re also ex pe rimen ting with that.
And we ren ted lo cally a bo ut ac ci den tally.
We were first sen ding the so und or vi a fight to Italy, and then sen ding in the bank to o ur pla ce to re cog ni ze it.
And only then we we a re.
We a re re cog ni zing it.
So this do ub le do ub le net work low to has kil led that has ca u sed the de lay
next time we. We wo uld like to re cog ni ze it on the spot.
And and the the prob lem was gone
a ga in.
Now, so und ac qu i siti on.
Yo u may re cog ni ze some of uh, o ne of o ur col le a gu es he re.
And the prob lem is if if yo u have this mic rop ho ne that just mic rop ho ne, and yo u put it he re.
And then yo u talk to the sli ce like that.
The mic rop ho ne does not re ally get your ways.
So that is that is o ne prob lem.
This is a not her thing right now.
I wo uld un tru e to un for tu nate.
We had to switch off this just Mi ke num ber lying on this mo uth.
Mi ke, we wan ted to ex tend this test.
So ba sed on a thre e mi nutes of thus tes ting the er ror in re cog ni zing English, and check is of u se se veral po ints, the lo wer.
If yo u u se the mo uth mic rop ho ne com pa red to the chest mic rop ho ne.
So they a re just dis tan ce from the mo uth and the mo vement of the head that ma kes the me a surab le me a surab le dif fe ren ce.
So we a re rel ying on the on the bet ter on the head mic rop ho ne
in this pa per for sin gers.
So for vo calists.
The yo u have to hold the Mi ke pro perly.
Yo u have yo u have not the vi ew.
Yo u must not put it in your mo uth.
Almost, yo u must not put it to o far away from your mo uth.
And al so, if yo u stand in front of the lo ud spe a kers, the re ver be rati ons, will will to tally kill the sig nal that yo u a re re ce i ving thro ugh my.
So this is what has hap pe ned to us du ring the uh, the stu dent from first o ne, the stu dents were were just ro a ming a ro und,
and they and the the area in front of the lo ud spe a kers.
And sud denly the re was no way to to re cog ni ze them OK and.
Then the va ri ous cab les.
Yo u, have to plug the cab les pro perly.
And o ne of the set tings in the of the con fe ren ce in room for the in ter pre ters.
We were able to get the sig nal.
Only when o ne of the con nec tors. He re was not fully plug ged in.
The re a son is that we were like mi susing, the the con nec ti ons. So. Once once we bro ught a pro per so und card.
It was able to re cog ni se which, been of that the, con duc tor has want, but, with the pro per, some col le ges', the bu il ding some kind of stan dard no tebo ok.
Yo u have to like Miss a lig n.The the pin ce a re all that con nec ted to it to get the sig nal.
So so the the re was an hour or two of de bug ging un til we fi gure o ut how to con nect the in put. So that is we a re le ar ning.
So then the re is the vo lume set ting a long the a long the pi peli ne.
So. If yo u have a wi reless mic rop ho ne.
It has a re ce i ver, and the re is vo lume can throw the re ce i ver, and then yo u have a so und card, and that also has some blue con trol.
And it also has some bar ton, like two but tons.
So line le vel, or make le vel that is o ne but ton and put ting on or off.
So yo u have to that is like four op ti ons, at le ast just for the but tons, and then for the for the for the knobs, and yo u have to the said this.
So this pro perly. Other wi se. The so und can be the qu iet, or the so und will be to o to o high.
If the the vo lume wo uld be to o high, and so me o ne a long the pi peli ne will cle ar bit.
And then yo u do not get the fre qu ent fre qu en ci es, and the ears a re what will not work.
So yo u need to ca refully thre ad this sig nal step. By step ex pe ri en ce. Pe op le know.
I re mem ber the the good col le a gu e from the pa per was com pany who came for the stu dent fa res have for the first ti me.
And the re we still were strug gling with get ting the sig nal, right?
And he like fol low thro ugh on the Mi ke with the he ad pho nes al ways con nec ted as pho nes. And and that OK it. Is good he re. Is good he re, and.
And step by step.
He ma naged to de liver the the right vo lume to the mac hi ne. So that is yo u have to do. It is the pri ce, and it can fail at any po int.
Yep. So then it is o ur qu a lity.
So once yo u have de live red the pos sib le the best pos sib le sig nal. What does the mis si on re cog ni ze from that.
So this is an e xam ple from the from the stu dent, the high scho ol stu dents.
They ha ve. The spe a ker wan ted to say so met hing like yo u have a boat to, Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in the harsh in the he art of just go od. Wo uld yo u know it is.
But in the re ally did. This is high scho ol stu dent. So he sa id," yo u have a bot tle.
Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in he art of just get rid of it, so that the re was se ri ous miss pro nun ci a ti on. And the re was also high le vel of bac kgro und no i se, be ca u se that is fa ir.
So the re is the stands with mu sic play ing in.
We a re just be hind a lit tle a lit tle wall,
a ho ping to get. So me some shows a re from from all that ni ce.
So if yo u a re an ex pert, if yo u a re a per son.And yo u a re in this here in this in this harsh con di ti on s.Then yo u a re pro bably un der stand so met hing
like yo u have a bot tle, be ca u se yo u a re not ex pec ting the the stu dent to talk a bo ut a hold on the bo at.
Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in the he art of all. And then he wo uld re cog ni ze that some ci ti es be ing men ti o ned.
But if he is from Spa in, he wo uld not know that just they wo uld. Yo u know, is a is a is a check city.
This thun de red a us o ur Lord de liver so met hing li ke, Oh, yes, the the of the that is the the few words of his he art and sport in the in the no i se sig nal
is the a 's star is its no i se re sis tant. If it can so mehow can cel led the no i se. Then it will do so met hing
yo u have so mebody to Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in hard, which is can we do, be ca u se it does not know the the name of that ta kes it in.
And if we have a fu ture as o ur or a per son in the in the mid dle ac tu ally, and then we wo uld get the the pro per re cog ni ti on of the sen ten ce.
So this is a. This is all the prob lems that that we a re fa cing when we a re trying to tran scri be and non na tive spe a kers.
This is sum mary oc curs the re cor dings that we may have made the ir. So re mem ber, the word" er ror" rate for hu mans is a ro und six or four per cent
he re, the Go og le system, Go og le, as o ur head er ror rate of of nine dish.
Edin burgh system also show and car also system was ac tu ally the best o ne a ro und 40 still ten ti mes wor se than the was the hu mans do.
And this is this is on the re cor dings were all the systems have pro duced any o ut put what so e ver.
If we apply if we if pe op le have the same fi gures. But we fo und a 100 per cent of ot hers as the the the sco re.If no o ut put is de live red them.
Go og le is so much wor se than any im be ra. So I re mem ber was was bet ter. It was not like gi ving up .So fre qu ently,
Car los was still still the best system, but still the the car thro ugh a system is ten ti mes wor se than the hu mans.
And that is then what is re por ted in the li tera ture.
Obvi ously. This is hard con di ti ons.
So this is the gro und, no is non na tive spe a kers. Well. We a re not yet qu i te pro fes si on in the re cor ding.
So we just mi salig ned, the mi kes, and pe op le like tho se po ked yo u to o lo ud. And we did not do. That was the knobs of pro perly.
So it is it is very harsh con di ti ons.v But this is the the the re ally do that that yo u can get.
So this is the best re cor ding ac cor ding to the as o ur qu a lity, and the re a re things li ke, why do yo u wear tho se. So high he els
is that. Why do yo u wear tho se high heat the high he els.
And she de als in the re is no o ne re ally good star, in ste ad of the sto re that de als with the sale of free down fo od, in ste ad of free ti me, fo ot we ar,
or so met hing like that. So it is it is the to tally wrong.
Ok. So what is o ur plan gi ven this.
So we a re de fini tely go ing to ret ra in o ur his arm or ders, and I re ally wo uld like to u se non Na tive spe ech cor po ra,
com mon vo i ce by Mo zil la is o ne of this is that that can help.
And we have a not her fall like uh, the thing to do.
We wo uld like to fol low in ter pre ters in ste ad of the flo or, be ca u se each of the in ter pre ter will sit in the bo oth with li mited snow is
from sur ro un dings with bet ter mic rop ho ne. So we have more con trol of the re cor ding, we can also talk to the in ter pre ters and ex pla in to them
that they a re be ing re cor ded and pro ces sed in par tic le we ight, and we also have the chan ce to a depth of them.
So we a re trying to get the ir con tacts. We have still few months to co me.
And even if they a re non na tive, we sho uld be able to a depth of the ir par ti cular spe ech.
So we wo uld ca u se them to do as the lo ve.
Well, few mi nutes, the mob pos sibly up to an hour of of re cor ding wo uld pay them to what I
read so me. Thanks to o ur o ur in ter pret so met hing. And then we were to cre a te a tra i ning data set for that par ti cular per son.
And then ob vi ously, we a re go ing to get her in do ma in data at the so ut hern and re gularly. Apol lo e ight.
So does the Sri.
We get the text sown know what, what do we know? What do we ex pect? Now, what that tran sla ti on the re, all the stan dard tran sla ti on er rors that yo u know whe re well.
So here is o ne e xam ple, a sen ten ce, which was ac tu ally re cog ni ze per fectly.
I know which sen ten ces a re re cog ni zed per fectly. So I know what to a vo id when I 'm run ning demo
of this is also dif fe rent from the from the u sers of o ur system, they will simply is says," spe ak as they a re used to.
If I want to show ca se what o ur system is do ing. I will a vo id na med en ti ti es. I will a vo id stran ge con struc ti ons.
I will have like thro ugh and thro ugh new spa per, like a style of sen ten ces, and then all the all the systems will suc ces sfully or ga nized me.
So this is o ne of the the ca ses.
But it is much more dif fi cult to to ask if yo u do not have any clu e, and yet, the tran sla ti ons, both into Ger man,
and check ed to sam ple lan gu a ges were wrong. The if was tran sla ted as all pow, 'rs dock, um.
And that is that black dis torts the this to wards the the sen se of of that.
So might gu ess is that may be in English, yo u wo uld in in Na tive English. Yo u wo uld ac tu ally say this a lit tle bit dif fe rently.
And then the re might be more ex pli cit clue in the so ur ce.And then I 'm not say ing that the sen ten ce in English is wrong.
I 'm say ing that in de ed tra i ning da ta, which is from news or may be bo oks, or or or yo u have le gis la ti on.
Men. The re is this sli de do ma in. Is much any even even if it is not do ma in mis match.
This is is ge nerally am bi gu ous con jun cti on, and it is dif fi cult for the mac hi ne to gu ess the me a ning.
So if yo u a re clo ser to the tra i ning da ta, then yo u will se e it will work bet ter.
If if it is a dif fi cult, an am bi gu ous ex pres si on.
Yo u will have the se prob lems mo ved to flo at like for ever yet.
He re is some some just mi sun der stan ding or well, as the it was o ut of wor k.Every the mis si on tran sla ti on system,
Ra nald Hun gary, yo u can be re por ted af ter some pro fani ti es.
So if yo u if yo u say so met hing bad on your web si te, then they will flow like bo ok, yo u know.
And that was the most tran sla ted as pro fes si o nal thinks
that is be ca u se of the prop het is, we a re not in the in the book of very of the mis si on tran sla ti on system.
So the re sor ted to sup port ex pres si ons.
Okay, ah, the prob lem in spo ken English tran sla ti on is that the ants a re He i ress. Get kind of mul tip li ed in mac hi ne tran sla ti on.
If yo u have an er ror in spe ech re cog ni ti on.
Then the er ror will be a few e dits a sin gle word si milar in sha pe the what I have set.
But then yo u take this sin gle word and yo u tran sla ted, and then the sha pe of the word" like the to tally chan ges."
So mac hi ne tran sla ti on ta kes all the wrong words. From the ears a re as full of thrust forth and need hap pily re al .The re is a sen ten ce to make it
the best pos sib le sen ten ce, in clu ding tho se strong words, and the re is no in for ma ti on a bo ut the con fi den ce, ne it her from this ar tist them,
nor from the Mis si on fo un da ti on system.
So the so the user will be just left with the sen ten ce, which so unds per fectly na tural love men ti on some French en ti ti es,
which were ne ver ne ver men ti on ne ver part of the dog, be ca u se they co me. They come from an er ror.
So here is an e xam ple. And the goal of my fe es. This is to fold, and the re was two fold. So in ste ad of two fold.
This a re good as this to fa ult, that is the na tural like miss re cog ni ti on of the empty o ut put was.
And the goal of my the ory is that of the se is is to fall a part.
So the re is de fini tely not what what we were af ter in this is that so that yet.
So this is. This is what I wo uld pro bably tran sla te the dow nsi de it to o. If I was the o ne thing a bo ut.
I just wan ted to hig hlight this to fold to miss re cog ni zed. This two fold was tran sla ted as well as the bits that to fall a part.
And that is to tally o ut of o ut of the sco pe. Ok.
So what we ha ve, what what is o ur plan for the mis si on tran sla ti on, da ta, data da ta, and then may be lit tle bit of mo dels.
So we a re de fini tely go ing to get her more cal led a dump. And in the u niver se that num ber is wor king on that.
We a re go ing to get the more tar gets, si de, mo nolin gu al data and make them sla te that is for the do ma in a dap ta ti ons. So this is al re ady think do ma in.
So we wo uld like like yo u to fo cus on all the se ma teri als. They a re hardly Pa o lo.
So me of them a re, but not to o many, and es pe ci ally not for tho se like 19, no new lan gu a ges that we a re also na ming it.
So ho pefully o ur ba seli ne systems in the back tran sla ti on will make some sen sib le o ut put from that, and ho pefully will be able
to im pro ve the vast i nequ a lity
will cre a te in do ma in test sets, and we re gularly able wait on them.
We also tri ed to get in to uch with the ho u se. Aga in. That is the col lec ti on of the user sup pli ed
Apol lo da ta, and they can give an ar tist says," they can ex tract the most si milar sen ten ces.
So to sum up like fil te ring off off lar ger pool of Apol lo da ta.
We a re also trying to cre a te gu ess the te ars so lace to ug her live on men into the se like par ti cipants, or or the pre sidents of the Sup re me a u dit of fi ce says,"
this is ha ving just the list of na mes.It is not i de al for for ma ti on tran sla ti on. What is that re ally bet ter than not hing.
So we will. We will try this as well. I 'm also con si dering.
And this is so met hing that may be some o ne of yo u co uld try. I 'm con si dering to to tra in mac hi ne tran sla ti on on dis tor ted so ur ce,
be ca u se I wo uld pre fer. The mis si on was, this is them to say so met hing in the do ma in and sen sib le rat her than to ah, to like
try to who and per fectly tran sla te the wrong way us o ur o ut put.
So for me, it ten ta tively. I 'm say ing that uh, it se ems to be bet ter to say so met hing si milar or re lated
to re ad. The Den is the like do per fect os cil la ti on of the wrong im port.
They will se e whet her this is good as sum pti on, or not, if if the system starts ma king up the con tent.
Then ob vi ously, the u sers will not be happy as well. But right now,
o ur system is to o easy to to like that that that the that it is to o easy to to note is that o ur system is do ing so met hing wrong,
and we want to hi de. It is a bit un der the car pet.
So let us se e if this will be a good stra tegy or not. And let us se e if we ma nage to tra in such a mo tor,
and I 'm af ra id that we will ne ver get she du ring this few months to the in te res ting things like this, this be ca u se gen der.
Obvi ous ly.The mac hi ne tran sla ti on system has no in for ma ti on a bo ut the gen der of the spe ech,
the Pall. They wo uld have to his sto od to tally like Mo on, Non la beled to ha ve.
It does not know a bo ut that .Thank yo u.
And no new English does not mark a most sen ten ces for the gen der of the spe a ker.
So it is very li kely that o ur system will be just ma king up and swit ching the gen der of the of the spe a ker in the first per son sen ten ces,
and that will be very con fu sing for the a u di en ce.
So well, I 'm af ra id that we will not get to this, un less the re is so me o ne who wo uld like to o kay.
Then the in teg ra ti on of the a ce a re an empty of or der set s R.M it is the rings off,
lo wer ca se words, mis si on tran si ti on ex pects in di vidu al co u ric sen ten ces.
So the re a re num ber of op ti ons that we can try to brid ge the gap.
So we can try to in the ir pun ctu a ti on into the as o ur o ut put, which we call the seg men ter, or we can chan ge the as sor row to pre dica te di rectly
co u ric, pun ctu a ti on. So the spe ech re cog ni ti on with the run not into just se qu en ce of fo rests, but se qu en ce of words with pun ctu a ti on and
ca pita liza ti on plan. A stu dent of mine is is wor king on this. And we can also try so met hing which is o ne of the re se arch ghosts of o ur pro ject
that is for the end to end spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on with o ne ne u ral system that re ally gets the so und in o ne lan gu a ge and pro duces
the tran sla ti on in the in the tar get lan gu a ge right a way. So that is a ga in part of Pe ter 's the sis.
So the seg men ter gi ven us thre e or fo ur. It is gets pun ctu a ti on ca sing. Co uld we u se the ot her car stilts, ah, to ol, so me, so so me o ne sto ol.
Unfor tu nately, the spe ech in for ma ti on is no lon ger ac ces sib le to this to ol. So it has just the se qu en ce of words. And ba sed on the se qu en ce of words.
It is gu es sing sen ten ce bo un da ri es. And as o ne of my col le a gu es from the ro om. A dis co ur se spe ci a lists sa id," The is ac tu ally do ing very good job gi ven
that it does not have any in for ma ti on a bo ut the pa u ses of all the in for ma ti on. So it is sur pri sing how well it can pre dict the sen ten ce bo un da ri es
with this the poor in for ma ti on. So still, it is it is far from per fect. So the re a re many er rors.
And the re is also a not her to which the war to con si der the in to nati on and and de lays, but we have not had time to in teg ra ted.
So if so me o ne wo uld like to play a ro und with that wo uld be happy to it till we get to an yhow the re.
So it was sunk. It sug gests rain this, this seg ment or tool on ching da ta, both four mil li on sen ten ces.
And here is the Pre cisi ans and re calls for va ri ous pun ctu a ti on mar gins. We a re in ser ting and how hig hlig hting the re call of
pe ri od, be ca u se that is cri tical to to i den tify sen ten ce bo un da ri es. So it is 70 to a to a two per cent, which is re a sonab le,
if yo u look at it as a num ber, but it is still far from suf fi ci ent for prac ti cal u se.
Okay. So here is an e xam ple of an er ror in in the us. In the seg men ta ti on so He i ress, im pre cisi on, only two con fu sing empty o ut put.
So he re, the spe a ker sa id," so met hing like all to o. Well, that was part of a lon ger lon ger phra se,
and the us a re plus seg men ter, but put a full stop bet we en this lake in the mid dle of this phra se," re li e ving to the o ut put.
This ap pro ach does not ge nera lize all to o and then se para te sen ten ce. Well, so to so mehow con clu de that the who le talk.
So here the se man tics is ob vi ously chan ged qu i te bit. This is e xactly the case whe re the mac hi ne tran sla ti on wo uld burst o ne by o ne re ce i ved the first sen ten ce,
and then the se cond sen ten ce, and it wo uld have no way to re cover from a from the full stall, which sho uld not be the re in the first pla ce.
So the re to to sen ten ce. This wo uld get like be au tiful, but the the the mes sa ge wo uld be dis tor ted er rors in the re call, ah,
make to o much con tent, un stab le, and will ex pla in this on on on the fol lo wing flights.
So here is a not her tec hni cal think uh, the the mes sa ging bet we en the spe ech re cog ni ti on and spo ke English tran sla ti on.
So it is if it is the on li ne spe ech re cog ni ti on. We a re re ce i ving text mes sa ges a bo ut this text mes sa ges. Offspring was off. Words
a re not re lated to sen ten ce bo un da ri es. So in the first run. And this is what we what we were mostly se eing in in March, or that is all
the ses si ons that the word of tests for for the Sup re me, what of fi ce. We were re ce i ving the se mes sa ges. So.
This is the first mes sa ge, the se cond mes sa ge, third mes sa ge and 4th mes sa ge, and we were di rectly sen ding the se mes sa ges
to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on. So the first mes sa ge was yo u sho uld think the re have be en, and they a re. They a re still un fi nis hed. Invents
mac hi ne tran sla ti on system. Gi ven this im plo de de cided to to tally on with the first sen ten ce, be ca u se the first, and then like
does not fe ed. The ir mis si on tran si ti on system is tra i ned to tran sla te fal se and then ce into full sen ten ce. So some half sen ten ce
he re. Let us drop it. So it is said to just Dick. We just think, yo u know, and then the law. This is an ex ten si on of that mes sa ge.
So the is o ur sent a ga in, the same pre fix. And then it en ded the ex tra words that came in the me an ti me.
And this is pro bably the best tran sla ti on that the empty co uld have de live red for that, and then the his hor se and so met hing which we call
the con fir ma ti on mes sa ge. So the is o ur says," well, I will not bot her with the se thre e words an ymo re. Yo u sho uld think I will just lo ve.
I 'm Phil fi nali zing the se. And from now on, I will only send yo u the rest. The re have been many re volu ti ons.
So here is a sin gle mes sa ge. Yo u sho uld think. So that is o ne com ple te sen ten ce. And the be gin ning of a not her sen ten ce, and we have
tran sla ted as as if it was on ce. And and that is that is just wrong, and then the next mes sa ge stars in the mid dle of the sen ten ce al re ady.
And we a re a ga in fe e ding it as if it was a com ple te sen se. And so the re is like the sen ten ce bo un da ri es a re to tally u nob ser ved by o ur ap pro ach,
and that that kills e ver ything, and it e mits it. It is um gre ats all of the se par ti al sen ten ces into full sen ten ces. But that is not re lated to the
the the what the what the pe op le sa id," OK so. If yo u put to get her the the as sor row and the bet ter. And we did it in mo ti on on the fol lo wing si ze,
then yo u still need to Pre sident so mehow the re sult. So that is whe re it is slowly co ming to wards the the fi nal sta ge, and still,
it can to tally kill the the show. Ah, this. If yo u have fo und two small, such as in the sub tit les, if they were a lit tle bit smal ler it.
They will not be of any u se for yo u at all. So yo u need to very ca refully ba lan ce like how much con tent yo u put to so mew he re.
And if the pho ne wo uld be e ligib le. If it is still, if it is le gib le for pe op le in the first row.And for the pe op le in the last thro ugh
if they have to rely on the cell pho ne. And sud denly they have a dif fe rent sha pe sha pe, dif fe rent rec tan gu lar area whe re the tran sla ti ons
and tran scrip ti ons.Abby.And this he a vily af fects how much in for ma ti on we can send for them, and we have to dyna mically de cide what what the sent them.
And and what not the, for e xam ple. Then if if if this text, flick ers to o much. If the worst chan ge to o qu ickly. Yo u can thre e them.
So that is o ne of the re a sons why we have not em ploy ed the fully ne u ral net work as o ur system so far, be ca u se they a re tra i ned
to o pera te on win dow that mo ves in ti me. So uh, e ight se conds at o ne go a re al ways re cog ni zed, and the be gin ning can chan ge.
So i magi ne e ight se conds of my spe ech bank, and still like a Re ed de ciding what is the first word, as mostly the words do not chan ge,
but so meti mes they do. And if yo u have this long pi e ce of text, and the like swaps that he re. And the re ah, the re and back on on va ri ous pla ces.
In va ri ous worst. Yo u do not know how to fol low that. It is it is like on stab le text. So we a re wor king on this on this in teg ra ti on.
And I wan ted to hig hlight. This pre sen ta ti on must be tes ted on sta ge. Yo u can have tes ted in si mula ti on, like
good that the si zing of that day, as the vi sibi lity from va ri ous a re as that all can kill. It can ne gati vely af fec ted in such way that
it is not u sab le at all. If yo u have ever or der so met hing from any shop, and it ca me, but it was like the wrong si ze. I that to smal ler to o big.
Then, yo u know what I 'm tal king a bo ut a in an is su e up. Yo u have a pic tu re of what yo u a re buy ing. But the pic tu re is o ut of pro por ti on.
If yo u do not know, if yo u a re get ting this big that it bet ter, or or this tiny that bear the so it is it can be or have the wrong si ze,
and that the same thing as here for or for the sub tit les. So here is o ne of the vi ews that yo u have be en.
May be yo u have been wat ching on your mac hi nes. This is ma inly for show ca sing that we can a ro und the tran sla ti on into many tar get lan gu a ges.
So we a re sho wing two li nes of sub tit les in then lan gu a ges, the mo ment, and this will be 40 43.
This is good to de mon stra te that the system is fol lo wing me, and it can cre a te the fall slowly po siti ve im pres si on, be ca u se
if yo u a re fol lo wing me any, if yo u un der stand my my my lan gu a ge. Then yo u can not do. Yo u can no lon ger read ca refully. What is in the in the sub tit les,
and yo u were only ob ser ved the right, key words the re. So if I say so met hing a bo ut sub tit les, then yo u will se e to to look in check than yo u will no tice
a low gra de. The system is re cog ni zing this per son, but yo u a re not able to jud ge the qu a lity of the sen ten ces.
So the sen ten ces, in fact, a re pretty crappy, and they jump to qu ickly. And if yo u if yo u did not un der stand me. And yo u only had the se two li nes to fol low.
Then yo u wo uld get lost in the er rors of as a re empty. So this is. This is good to show off, but it is bet ter for the u se of.
So we have so met hing el se. We also show much lon ger con text. So the is that X is a gross. And here yo u have a no. This was pro bably gi ven in English.
And then it was tran sla ted into a check and Ger man. And he al re ady se e the dif fe ren ce bet we en the stab le o ut put, the par ti al o ut put
and the like the in co ming o ut put. So. So me of the se sen ten ces a re fully pro ces sed by all the pi peli ne of all the com po nents in the pi peli ne.
And the re is no way they co uld be up da ted any lon ger. And the se sen ten ces a re shown in a re shown in black, and then the ir sen ten ces,
which a re gra du ally be ing up da ted. And here still the pun ctu a ti on can can like make a dif fe ren ce. So that is why we a re sho wing this only in gre at.
And then the re is the last sen ten ce, which is still get ting more and more words, and as the seg men ter fi nis hes pro ces sing of some of this.
And then the 4th some full stop. He re will ap pe ar. And it will be o ut of the uh, the pro ces sing area of of the seg ment the re an ymo re, and it will be come
the black and full of stab le o ut put. He re yo u se e in the Y. The full stop re call is im por tant. If the full stop a re to o scars the re to o in fre qu ent
in the o ut put. Then to o much of text will re ma in in this gray face and do much of tics will like be still un de cided in flick e ring,
pe op le will wait wait to o long for the stab le o ut put. And yo u also that it is also like mat ter of tas te, whet her pe op le wo uld like to fol low the more
the more un stab le Ma u rice and o ut put, or whet her they wo uld like to have full only the stab le o ne, but be se veral se conds be hind the spe a ker,
so that the dif fe ren ce. So this is so met hing that we have to up da te. And i de ally, it wo uld be the u sers cho i ce.
Wo uld yo u like to have the the the shor test pos sib le de lay at the risk of fi ce, the re a ding so met hing which will be still like fi xed,
or wo uld yo u like to wait lit tle lon ger un til o ur o ut put is stab le. So that is so met hing that the the i de ally, the the user wo uld cho o se
who, so if pe op le a re pro vided with this lon ger con text, then they can bet ter re cover from er rors a long the bike li ne.
So it is al most im pos sib le to fol low the con tent of a dog, which is not known to yo u.If it is not to o far from the do ma in of the tra i ning of the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system.
Ah, a ga in, and yet.And so here is a lit tle sum mary of what has to be do ne. If yo u a re pre sen ting checks only in the two li nes of sup pli ed link.
So yo u have some this a re. So this is some English has thre e or four words, pi xels on your scre en.At any gi ven mo ment.It is also very fle xib le.
Archi tec tu re of this is an en ti re bo ok. So yo u se e that the re is no as sent and bo un da ri es. And the seg men ter ne eds to pre dict some sen ten ce bo un da ri es
so ap. It is pre dic ted a full stop here and a full stop he re.And then some is o ur de bate co mes.And it also ba sed on this day, the seg men ter has
a not her up da te. So it pre dicts o ne more full stop he re. So this is like a se qu en ce is self up da tes co ming. And some of the se sen ten ces a re al re ady
com ple ted. So the seg men ter says," this full stop this fi nal. I will ne ver ne ver take it back do with this sen ten ce, wha tever yo u li ke, will not to uch it to them.
So me of the se. So me of the se for ce of a re still un stab le. So I 'm a a re move this full stop, and I mo ved slightly. And then we also have to
to like han dle that pro perly.And then as the Us.And the res t.The last sen ten ce is only Qs ex pec ted or in co ming like we do not know what what the sen ten ce.
What will fi nish like we a re sen ding now full sen ten ces to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system .So that is the the the re is like who go od. Now.
That me ans that the.And this is them his brow of fed with the in put is re ady for .So now, go ing into Ger man.It will say," let us that so met hing like
picks them all fre e dom .Bill show him that su i ted him tight bo om, co uld as sist all.I know is that fle xib le he retics, or as it is. So.
So this ma kes this ma kes sen se. This is like Co u ric jud gment, and then says," The is su e is how much spa ce yo u have to show this Ger man to u se it.
So if we have two li nes of sub tit les that, wo uld that wo uld show this yel low part and this yel low part.And then, be ca u se the last sen ten ce got
some ex tra words.It got ex ten ded, the the the system de cided to chan ge the be gin ning of of this sen ten ce them .They de cided to chan ge the last word
on the first sub tit le li ne.If the lime this like still vi sib le. We can e a sily do the chan ge.And not hing bad hap pens.If we a re li mited to just o ne line of sub tit le
o ut put .Then this line has been al re ady rol led o ut like the the the the user can no lon ger seed the u ser, so it a se cond a go. But now this is no
lon ger ac ces sib le. So we wo uld have to show the like only half of the sen ten ce, and that is so met hing that we can not do. So the so met hing has chan ged.
We call this. The rest sa id," now, the now the se sub .Tig hte ning mec ha nism has to go back and show so met hing which has or disc rol led up and show it a ga in.
So that is the user can re ad .But this thre e sa id," is ex tre mely an noy in g.So yo u may have no ticed no ticed that so meti mes this .The sub tit les got
the right. And the the wretch ef fect is e xactly hig hlig hting ar res ted has hap pe ned .So the the the seg men ter .The se cond, most os cil la ting like whe re
to put some of the full stops were to put the ah, the ca sing chan ges and gave the chan ge of the full stop, or the ca sing hap pe ned a bove the edge in
the li ne, which al re ady rol led up .Then the sub tit le, even put here for a us a re is su ed ar res ted, and it also in di cated in red .So the red for me.
It was like re mote. Yes. This is the rest. So this is the this is the case whe re the sub tit les had to scroll back, be ca u se so met hing was up da ted o ut si de of the scre en,
so the de ad .But that is an il lus tra ti on of why the li mited o ut will spa ce is so cri tical for de live ring the that tran sla ti on to the u ser,
if yo u li mit yo ur self, to o much, if the lan gu a ge dif fe ren ces, to o big. And so the wards re or de ring and the length of the sen ten ces of like make yo u
yo u lar ger bits that then fit on the fi nal scre en, then the user will be ex pe ri en cing a very con fu sing re set s.So I 'm like stres sing this, be ca u se this
is so met hin g.This is .The se a re de cisi ons that yo u make a long the who le pi peli ne.And it is only the very last bit the size of the win dow that kills it,
or or ma kes it make it wor kab le. So that is that is why we a re like fig hting in the con sor ti um .Why?What is the bet ter o ut put of the.It se ems ba sed on
the se ar gu ments that yo u wo uld de fini tely do not want to have the sub tit le so up .Yo u pre fer yo u. Yo u sho uld pre fer the lon ger pa rag raph yo u that that yo u
saw on the pre vi ous sli de. But the prob lem here is that if yo u if yo u make some very bad mis s.They gave some some bad word of some pro fanity ap pe ars
in the o ut put.It will still be the re for to o long.And pe op le like that, they go the ir cell pho nes and and take pic tu res of the Bill that bed we re.
So ah, yo u a re ex po sing to o much of of your prob lems in this that .So that is why that is why the the some some par tners in the con sor ti um pre fer red
the the sub tit les .But the re is a big risk of of the sub tit les be ing in com pre hen sib le. Ok.So then the re is the o verall cog ni tive lo ad, and the the the
o verall u sabi lit y.We have to u ser s.They a re here who corn for him de ad .So so so no o ne over the re. The re is many that that is a not her the the stu di es.
So the re is so many u sers who have tri ed to fol low .This have said that that the re is no way that yo u wo uld be fol lo wing the tran sla ti on on your no tebo ok.
And lo o king at the sli des of the spe a ker, who is in front of yo u, even if it is like in the very clo se an gle.If yo u do not have to move your eyes to o much.
Yo u still have to ac co moda te be ca u se of the dif fe rent dis tan ce, and, that will take some ti me. And.Then yo u will se e as soon as yo u look up at the sli des.
Yo u will lose the sub tit les, then yo u will lose con ten t.So we a re now wor king on en ding the sli des, but also to the the scre en whe re the sub tit les
ap pe ar, or the ot her way a ro und put ting sub tit les to uh, to the scre en, whe re that with the fli es a re. So this is so met hing which which has to be do ne.
And then the old u sabi lit y.The o verall u sabi lity is still very bad lo ve. Invi ting yo u who e ver does not spe ak French, and wo uld like to join us.
We a re. Ho pefully this we ek, we a re run ning like a French mo vi e wat ching ses si on, or just ten mi nutes of it that dark, we do not spe ak French.
So we will fol low o ur systems, re cog ni zing the French and tran sla ting into English, or or check or any ot her lan gu a ge. Ain 't it .We will try to come up
with im pro vements that wo uld make it ac tu ally u sab le be ca u se it is very big dif fe ren ce, whet her yo u can un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge, or or not
o ur .We had a si milar ses si on with much im pro per pre sen ting so met hing on mac hi ne tran sla ti on, e volu ti on in check any Ross and then did by o ur to
fo re ign stu dents.And the se two fo re ign stu dents re por ted that they co uld fol low the check ed dog, if they fully fo cused on the pa rag raph fu el,
as soon as they lo o ked upon the sli des, they got los t.So if with full at ten ti on to the sli ce.It was pos sib le to fol low it.
But this is not for a nor mal u sers, like nor mally, u se. Tho se have to yo u have to have some free time for the ir for the ir bra ins as well.
I wo uld like to hig hlight that that .The se a re set ting dif fers from Hug hes Abu se it .Tho se who un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge will need the si milar to new Gle e,
and they wo uld pre fer it all or pre cisi on and sta bility, if yo u a re fol lo wing what I 'm say ing," then the.And if yo u a re re a ding the sub tit les in your mot her
tank, then they co uld pro vide yo u with the words that yo u mis sed.If yo u do not un der stand word.It co uld ap pe ar he re. Yo u wo uld un der stand it,
but it has to be the re, and the like on the spot.And at the mo ment, when I said the word, if it is the re a re thre e se con ds.After then yo u, it was of no
u se to yo u any mo re, be ca u se it like yo u have mo ved in what yo u a re lis te ning al re ad y.So if yo u a re fol lo wing the so ur ce lan gu a ge. The sub tit les in
your Mot her dun can help yo u, but they have to be im me di a te.If yo u do not un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge, then yo u a re only rel ying on the text.
And in that ca se, yo u wo uld pre fer stab le it in pre cisi on, and yo u a re happy to wait for se cond ste wed .Yo u do not know what I 'm tal king a bo ut it all.
So it is not a prob lem.If if yo u get my mes sa ge e ight se conds la ter .So this is two very dif fe rent u se ca ses.And it sho uld be the user to se lect,
which which of the dis plays is the is that not not just OK so in ha lati on the re. Are thre e as pects of spo ken English tran sla ti on .Qu a lity does so met hing
that we know from mac hi ne tran sla ti on.And we know how to have va gu ely es ti mate the tran slu cent qu a lity, but the re is also the la ke.
How much is the text in the tran sla ti on de lay ed be hind the so ur ce of some of the La ke is ob vi ously i nevi tab le, be ca u se yo u have to wait for the Ger man
verb, or we have to an ti cipa te it in some way, and the re is flick er .So.If yo u have a system, which is up da ting, and we have such system s.Then the se
systems can an ti cipa te, and they have the ca pacity to co ring them sel ves .So then sud denly they can cre a te some o ut put, and then re move it in the next
step.And this has to be con trol led very much so that the user is not con fu se. So we a re wor king on an e volu ti on to with him an sorry, and hi de ous as as the them, the most se ri ous prob lem.
If yo u have this English, as a re the do. Yo u know, it is cat is not it .Yes.It is like that .So let us i magi ne that the Seg men ter has seg men ted into the se
two chun ks.The re is no way to a lign it .Well, with this Ger man tran sla ti on, the ir fri ends, be ca u se it has thre e sen ten ces that the do ors a re gro u ped in
a dif fe rent way in the sen ten ces .So we have to do is so mehow for ce a lign the se. So that the ba sic set of u nits that we a re ever le a ding over is com mon to all systems, re gar dless of what the English.As o ur do es.Uh, e ver ybody has to re ach the
same re feren ces seg men ta ti on .So the re is some stra tegi es.I 'm not go ing into the into the bills, any mo re. Essen ti ally we have the op ti on to
work with the se sen ten ces, un li ke con si der more sen ten ces at the same ti me, or we can to tally for get sen ten ces, and we can ever laid by em ploy ing
30 se conds chun ks.So did the the empty the as so the pi peli ne, the the uh .So the pi peli ne pro duce the right words wit hin the se 30 se conds.
And if it did then, yes, if not the not .So this is this is like way to go a ro und the prob lems of sen ten ce, this not be ing o ut the re in in spe ech
at all yet .So the se arch for the mo bili zati on.As I as I say it .The bat tle tor so. Usab le system is still not los t.So we a re now bu il ding of an
army of paid vo lun te ers.And if yo u have any pro col le a gu es or stu dents who can help us bet we en now and may or Ju ne, we a re to tally happy to take them
on bo ar d.So we a re me e ting at le ast once a week for just 30 mi nutes and dis cus sing was wor king on lot, and we have funds for this.
So this is like ah, as a new paid work, and yo u can do many smal lish tas ks.For e xam ple, if yo u a re lo o king at some of the empty o ut puts.
The re co uld have been bad cha rac ters, be ca u se no o ne has yet fly co uld check to whe re they come from in the pi peli ne. Then the re is lar ger, but the
things that we need to de velop .We wo uld like to have a as a das hbo ard, which we will give a con fi gura ti on like a life system, run ning which gross locks tho ught look fi les and does that bo ard sho uld loss that im me di a tely se e, whe re is the prob lem.
So for e xam ple, if we a re re cog ni zing the English bo oth with the French, as a re then the re will be many of fri en dship words, co ming from the systems, but they
will be to tally wron g.The re is the the most la ug hab le o ut put. I have seen so far like swap ping the lan gu a ges for the as a re be ca u se the the system
still strug gle.It will be like says," The word" si milar with pro nun ci a ti on, but in the wrong lan gu a ge, and the sen ten ces will not make any sen se what so e ver.
So this can e a sily hap pen.If yo u a re fol lo wing six im ports and tran sla ting into 43 lan gu a ges .Yo u need a con ci se view to to to know what your systems
a re do in g.So that wo uld be das hbo ar d.Then a lot of work on that do ma in and spe a ker a dap ta ti on, just just get ting in to uch with all the in ter pret tho se who wo uld be in the bo oth and con duc ting them, as king them to come here re cord an hour e ach.
And then u sing this, they have got to have the system .Aga in.A lot of a lot of lit tle work co at, swit ching is so met hing which I have not dis cus sed
in my talk at al l.But I 'm re a lizing how fre qu ent it is not only in lin gu is tic lec tu res, whe re we have e xam ples in four lan gu a ges,
but also na tive spe a kers of ot her lan gu a ges, the English fre qu ently, but bring in English phra ses, and the as o ur systems a re to tally not re ady for that.
So then the it is very si milar to to a bove the na med ex pres si on or na med.And it is, it is simply an own words that get re cog ni ze into so met hing very, very bad.
And then when this gets tran sla ted is still, the re were la ug hab le. The re is also a not her ac ti vity, which wo uld re ally like to start call in le at her
clim bin g.So it is when yo u have fi xed tes ted, and your wor king on im pro vements have your mo del of or the pi peli ne. So your ma king many small chan ges,
and yo u a re al ways o ver lo a ding on that that is that is .So yo u a re clim bing the le at her of per for man ce. So this is this is what we have to run a.
I 'm ho ping for like two big ger Mo dal rid .The ret ra i ning says," un til un til may and many ar chi tec tu re chan ges, many like smal ler fi xes that can im pro ve
the disk or qu i te a bit pa in t.Yo u up for the tal ked a bo ut this .So the re is the re is bo ard, but it is still so met hing dif fe rent.And they sup port is like tec hni cal.
Uh, set up Yo u want to know that the so und vo lume from all the six im ports. This is the right was the small, the so ur ce mo nitor .Yo u as su me that the
tec hni cally the ar chi tec tu re is all set of well, but still, yo u need to de cide which of the as a re in the com bi nati on of the spe a ker works best,
and which of the se so ur ces de livers the best tran sla ti on qu a lity into the many tar get lan gu a ges .So this is like a tec hni cal check that e ver ything is
run ning.And this is se lec ti on of the best pos sib le thro ugh the for the bes t.The o ut put wan ted them to sum ma rize of the ir le a der sub si ding, a is a big
chal len ge for the pro ject, even if yo u con nect to su per hu man com po nen ts.They can still Del hi were crept to get her.
So we a re now wor king on ma king this u sab le, tec hni cally the com plex pi peli ne now works.It has been wor kin g.How many res tart as that yo u have to know do some good mot her.
Okay ?So it is not seem less, but with o ne o pera tor.It can sur vi ve 60 mi nutes of of spe ech and the. But un for tu nately, even with this who le system, wor king the be nefit for the end user is still li mited or no nexis tent.
So.If yo u did not fol low my English spe ech.If yo u only had chan ce to read the check tran sla ti on.I 'm cu ri ous how much yo u wo uld get.
So this is o ne of the. We a re tru e. We have still a few months a go. So I 'm very lucky that that .We have the se months to to fix the pi peli ne.
And some of the prob lems that will a re run ning into a re not go ing to be sold in the next two, thre e, five ye ars.
But some of them can be fi xed .The soul will do o ur best to to make the the the o ut put ac tu ally u sab le,
and she goes to ple a se. Ple a se join us.
Ah, be ca u se ah, is to be a blue with us that that is it .So we have a tec hno logy, which tec hni cally wor ks.But it is to tally u nusab le.
And and I 'm cu ri ous, how how far we get in in the se mon ths.So we a re run ning this .This a re male or this this mo bili zati on
So we seek for your help and just talk to any of us .So may be tho se view who a re al re ady on the se arch team will just ra i se your hand.
So that pe op le se e tho ugh o ne to thre e. So the yacht so so at le ast for for pe op le in the room al re ady.And if yo u have more of yo u.
If yo u have stu dents who wo uld like to get in to uch with this .This is a ni ce.It is not sum mer .Inter nship is like spring, spring in ter nship.
Ple a se, ple a se, let them know, and yo u can read all the de ta ils a bo ut the pro ject in the block.And if yo u want the the real truth, then talk to us
di rec tly.Ye ah, OK than k.Yo u. Than kYo u all.At some de ta ils yet hun ger.
Well, yo u spo ke a bo ut the the the prob lem from a on this a re.If the re is a mis ta ke in un der stan ding of the of the wor d.and it brings the prob lem
for her to go to the mis si on tran sla ti on, and they also spo ke a bo ut the the mo dule, that puts the pun ctu a ti on into into the ste am of wo e who works
did .Did yo u con si der some some sink, like the mo on, some sort of Brim mer truck er, or some lan gu a ge mo del .Let us put it check whet her the sam ple sen ten ces
a re re ally sen ten ces or dra mati cally good e no ugh to be sent to mac hi ne tran sla ti on was the mos t.So yes, and no this who le pun ctu a ti on in ser ti on
to seg men t.The re is the lan gu a ge mo del as suc h.So that is that is like and Gra ham ba se, but it is not an gra ham.It is it is lon ger se qu en ces.
It is the ne u ral net work ba sed and rang which more tru e.And it is tra i ned on the con ca tena ted sen ten ces .But I think the se sen ten ces a re con ca tena ted
from or der shuf fled tra i ning set .So it has this like the sen ten ces came be came ed ges ad ja cent just by ran dom ness, and not by a pro per lo cal con text.
So the re is a cer ta in li mita ti on .So that is the re is the best part of of that .So it to tally re li es on some lan gu a ge mo del in the end, the sta tis ti cal
cents more and some gram ma tically," of the sen ten ces in no, no, we a re not con si dering that at all, be ca u se so well, we also do not as su me that pe op le
wo uld ot her Gram ma tically Co ur t.Sen ten ces so that is the um the the, prob lem, or that does that yo u may be re fer ring to the wo uld be cal led spe ech
re con struc ti on.And this is so met hing that that o ur De par tment has been wor king on in the boss as well they a re. The goal is to take the party
dis flu ency spe ech of of myself and con ver ted into a writ ten like this be ach, like pro per all only all good cho ric for gram ma tically pro per, sen ten ces,
but they were not wor king with with this com po nent at all in in o ur system .So qu i te on the con trary, we a re the re ot her mo ving to wards a mis si on
tran sla ti on systems, which will be ro bust to tran sla ting even the se a par ti al sen ten ces .So I have not men ti o ned in the sli des, but a not her of
stu dents of mine do minick.I 'm wat ching is wor king on on mis si on tran sla ti on, which runs not on sen ten ces, but on the win dow all for it is.
So we wo uld like to get rid of the seg men ter al to get her, and new wo ul d.Ho pefully if if we pro vided with rose and good tra i ning data that has this
pro per ty.Then the tran si ti on system wo uld be able to tran sla te this thro ugh an sen ten ces into dis flu ency vin ce 's u sab le in the tar get lan gu a ge,
which care the qu es ti on a bo ut the is su e of whe re to pla ce se e o ur mic rop ho ne, be ca u se se veral ti mes.I saw some spe a kers hol ding the ir mic rop ho ne
on that day cha in, like a nice he avy o ver se as does fre qu ent at all that the. They cla i ming that it.Is it is yo u? Can?
It is gone from the un der stan dab le.And and yo u pre vent flo wing he re.And the re we have not tri ed .So next next ti me. Yo u se e me gi ving a talk
a bo ut su rely hol ding mic rop ho ne, much che a per to o ver lo a ded pro perly.I re a lize that the re is no laws be ca u se here in the ro om.
But when yo u put the mic rop ho ne on the arch in your vo i ce has chan ged here in like in the in the loud in the in the wild.
And so I do not know, may be may be the re cor ding has not has not seen any chan ge, but we have OK i. Ha ve two small qu es ti ons of them .One. Qu es ti on con cerns or,
it is a re mar k.The re is a thing that if in to nati on is se para te yo u at ten ti on to, and then it might have for the sig nal.And then she got,
of co ur se, in the thro ne spe ec h.Pe op le do not be have. Accor ding to the ru les that is that is I have o ne qu es ti on for, yo u know, sli de num ber for for tis, or we have to.
I just won der that yet, tho ugh, tho ugh, bet we en low in the 34.In par t.Yo u have kept it does not, but yo u do not have to chan ge.I think this is bo oks.Ok.
So, so we do not know, I do not know if we can ac tu ally give it a try and find a la unch the re is, but whe re whe re is this an t?So.And so he re, ah, and di e in .So I will I will?
I will stop the live sub tit les, be ca u se it is ta king the or a pitch.It had a vi sitor on set .So I 'm I 'm cu ri ous myself be ca u se here is the pre sent,
be ca u se have o ne more ge neral qu es ti on, yes, so pre cise that if we just go to the pa rag raph yo u in the me an ti me gusts in the thin and the the mo on.
So let us switch of the him D and Hun ga ri an.And and it is o ne and a ze ro. So this is my English re cog ni zed, and it is be ing tran sla ted into Ger man, and in to check
a so a king up.And and and a more ge neral qu es ti on, which may be. Yo u have he ard se ven ti mes .How much can yo u le arn al l?Well, as stu di o, all con si dera ti ons of if yo u all is go ing the of tran sla tors,
in ter pre ters in ter pre ters it, just whe re the is si mul ta ne ous tran sla ti on .From the stra tegists also say that they a re.
So is this so met hing in the in the system, which wo uld ref lect this things me an, it is not yet.
Not at al l.We a re in to uch with them, be ca u se yo u like it.It helps us.
So we, we think that then we can get hold of the da ta, but the ir in ter pre tati on stra tegi es a re much more a long CA so. The long ran ge. So, to say,
so, they a re happy to lis ten to co up le of sen ten ces, even for the sum mit in his tran sla ti ons will soon wit hin. Tho se can still mean 20 se conds af ter that,
and they will first give the who le i de a, and they .They will spe ak it from Scratch.
And this is very dis tant from what we a re do ing, but we a re a i ming to get into the same bra in .So to say,
so we have no fo ol, o ur very first data sets whe re we have the so ur ce spe ech in English, which is be ing in ter pre ted live into check ed by some of the se stu dents.
And so we a re also tran scri bing the English.And we a re tran sla ting in the text for m.What was said in English,
and the e volu ti on tool that I men ti o ned that will con si der the qu a lity in terms of full bles sed or si milar sco re for mac hi ne tran sla ti on of the la ke.And the flick er is me ant it is not just that, but it is me ant to be ap pli cab le also to hu man in ter pre ters.
So i de ally, we wo uld se e that the hu man in ter pre ters a re much bet ter in pre cisi on, or the the qu a lity of the o ut put, but they will be much slo wer.
They will have much lon ger lax, and they will al way s.They have no flick ers or bu ri al li kely they wil l.Well, it will be dif fi cult to tran sport, the flick ers, be ca u se the the the way will be col lec ting the data
so, but wo uld re ally like to have a u toma tic thro ugh that vi o lates both fa cili ti es systems and in ter pre ters in in the same thre e sca les.
And then we se e what all the com pli men tary be nefits of of the se were like gro ups of of pro ces sors.
They stra teg y.So far a re a re not off any u se it to us.
And also the ir e volu ti on stra tegi es a re very dis tan ce from what we a re like tal king a bo ut.
So that that the that we have seen chec klist of when they a re be ing cre a ted the in ter pre ters, and yo u have so me. So me of the se i tems a re a re to tally ir re levant to o ur tec hno logy.
Ok.Thank yo u.
So I must chan ge. We have to stop at this po int.
