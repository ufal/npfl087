 Well, we a re Cor de li a Pro ject, the Uni ver sity of, but Edin burgh, in clu ding us, a re ex perts in mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 So to say cal led thro ugh his ex pert in inch spe ech re cog ni ti on
 Thank yo u for the in te rac ti on
 We have the top per for ming systems
 If we put them to get her
 I 'm sure it will work
 Gre at and pa ir wi se is an Ita li an com pany
 They have also been in vol ved in num ber of Eu rope an pro jects be fore, and they were al ways in the role of the in teg ra tor
 So they know how to put things to get her, and they have some ba seli ne systems that we can bu ild up on
 And then we have a user par tner all for yo u, which is re mote con fe ren cing system whe re we wo uld like to tran sla te what pe op le do what pe op le say in the in in the re mote calls and Hiv and ot her user par tner
 And the re is the sup re am a u dit of fi ce of the Czech Re pub lic
 And
 The Sup re me Au dit Offi ce
 Well, I 'm af ra id that he will in de ed se e it li fe
 They a re to o af ra id of of do ing an ything bad with with fi nan cing
 So did they did not want to get sin gle Eu ro
 So they a re not part of the pro ject, but they a re just then a few lady, yo u the par tner
 So they a re not sup por ted by the Eu rope an com mis si on
 Uh, o kay
 So the am bi ti on
 The am bi ti on is is very big
 We want to sup port a Con gress that the Sup re me a u dit of fi ce
 Runs this ye ar
 In the end of may or e arly Ju ne, and the par ti cipants of that Con gress come from many co un tri es, and in so me, they spe ak 43 lan gu a ges
 So so now this is a sum mary of the cur rent sta tus of the e lite, the pro ject whe re we a re trying to do life sup pli ed link into many tar get lan gu a ges, and I will bri efly des cri be how that works
 So this is well bey ond the ca pacity of a us off si mul ta ne ous in ter pre ting by hu mans, and we want to pro vide the mis sing lan gu a ges
 So to say, so, the re will be six lan gu a ges spo ken at that
 Con gress
 So English and French and Spa nish Ger man, Rus si an and check
 The se a re the of fi ci al lan gu a ges of the Con gress
 This will be ma nu ally in ter pre ted ac ross so that all the six a re pro vided, and we a re to pro vide the re ma i ning 43 ot her
 The the re ma i ning that the rest of the 43 lan gu a ges
 So this set off, yo u a re sel ling, which is lar ger than this, ar ti fici ally yo u lan gu a ges
 And that is also an im por tant re mark, be ca u se many of the se lan gu a ges a re much world as much shor ter off of da ta
 So the Eu rope an com mis si on
 Well, give it o ne more trying
 So the Eu rope an Uni on has al re ady put a con si derab le for ce into a da te
 Our so ur ce is the for some ye ars
 Ever ything from the Eu rope an Par li a ment was tran sla ted into all the lan gu a ges
 All the do cuments of the Eu rope an Uni on a re a va i lab le in all the lan gu a ges
 So we have so met hing to tra in on be fore the stand for lan gu a ges, but less soul for this 19 Edi son lan gu a ges
 And some of the se lan gu a ges have even so a brand new or un cle ar stay ed, as they had no gram mar
 Bo oks were writ ten for them yet
 So that is that is a chal len ge on its own
 Okay
 Ye ah, so the e vents
 If the re is an ything ap pe a ring, no does not se em
 We know that this all sho uld run
 So we have al re ady star ted
 The pro ject star ted last year in Ja nu ary, and in March
 We have ad ded o ne ex tra dry run
 So in o ur pro ject plan we ha ve
 We had like two dry run ses si ons
 And then the Con gress
 And we sa id," well, on the third at tempt to do e ver ything
 Well, so that as the 200 De lega tes, or 400
 If yo u come the de lega te and the ir and the ir fel low that the 400 pe op le will se e what what we have tes ted just two eyes be fore hand
 So, Oh, yes, the re is so met hing is hap pe ning
 That is im pos sib le
 So we have ad ded num ber of a num ber of ot her e vents
 The first o ne
 What hap pe ned in March
 Last ye ar
 It was the stu dent fare of fa ke, ther mos li ke mock mock bu siness com pa ni es
 And the re we were tes ting the al tar and Pre e xis ting tec hno logy wo uld ca u se to a he ad
 And what per was he ard,  and we just did o ur mac hi ne tran sla ti on system from English in ter ject then that we also got in to uch with the as I do not know the go od, the cor rect English name of the de par tment, but the De par tment for in ter pre ting in tran sla ti on and the fa culty of arts of o ur u niver sity
 And thanks to the ir sup port
 We a re able to at the end
 The re
 Mo re con fe ren ces were the in ter pre ters a re get ting tra in
 And we a re re cor ding the small pe op le in ter pre ters, and as the li kes of se eing what o ur systems can do with that mul tip le in puts
 So it is may be may be at the bot tom of the scre en
 So this is this is like si milar set ting whe re the re is in the ir brot hers in the wars, and we a re trying to fol low what they a re say ing and com pli men ted with the with the ot her lan gu a ges
 And then we had the two of fi ci al e vents that a re plan ned for o ur uh, for pro ject, that o ne was a wor king gro up on va lu e, ad ded tax, which hap pe ned in Ju ne,  and then right af ter the sum mer in Octo ber
 The re was a not her me e ting
 So the se two e vents were like qu i te clo se to each ot her,  not so not much
 The de velop ment was pos sib le bet we en the se two e vents
 And then in No vem ber, we also ad ded o ne more  was sho wing this tec hno logy in a lit tle demo on the month is open do ors
 They
 And I was also trying to pre sent it at best of proxy AI e vent and
 Then in Feb ru ary, so, very simply it
 We
 Had wor kshop, a dry run of wor kshop, which will also go run at the Con gress
 And the re the pur po se of the wor kshop is to de mon stra te not only mac hi ne tran sla ti on, but all ot her text pro ces sing or an o pi a te tec hno logi es to the a u di en ce to the lady u sers
 The Sup re me o rators
 It is is to il lus tra te how all the and Lp to ols can help them in the ir bu siness
 And we a re go ing to run this wor kshop, ob vi ously in English, and the re will be the lan gu a ge bar ri ers
 So the the o rators wo uld like to se e some tran sla ti ons of of that
 The re will be the only sub tit les of what I 'm say ing," it is to tally not cer ta in that it can be many flaws in tho se in tho se do not scripts and de libe rately were not sho wing that tran sla ti on, be ca u se the tran sla ti on has hard time in fe e ding into the se two li nes
 So the suc ces sful a demo was only in No vem ber, this was the big fa i lure, be ca u se they the wi fe
 I did not start
 Well, no men ti on that la ter on
 And then the the the long, clo se wor kshop
 Ever ything wor ked well, but it was ac tu ally still pretty u seless for the u sers
 And and ho pefully yo u will se e in the fol lo wing sli des
 Why this is the ca se
 This is the up co ming e vents
 The re is a ga me
 So the more con fe ren ce is af fec ted of ours  will a ga in for to se e them
 The re is a not her in stan ce, of the stu dent firms fa ir
 We a re a ga in, trying to uh, to get to that, be ca u se the size of the high scho ol stu dents have from ac ross the Eu rope, pro vide be au tifully non na tive spe ech
 But if yo u have a, but if yo u have to yo u your mac hi nes e ar, no bo oks, or or may be even cell pho nes with yo u
 So they a re very hard to uh, to un der stand for the ears a re system
 So we
 We get the test sets the re
 And Jo e
 We a re ma king it
 A sha red a re still to un der stand the se high scho ol stu dents,  then yes
 So uh, this is the this is the sha re task whe re we a re trying to get also ot her Re se arch Insti tute sto od to the pro cess that data that the high scho ol stu dents
 And then we will have a se cond run of all wor kshop
 May be we will add some ot her things
 And the main e vent is e arly Ju ne in here in Pra gu e, and they a re all them on this
  I me an, the re is so a ga in, and e very Mon day si milar, yo u will have a chan ce to to se e sub tit les
 Ok
 So here is a very bri ef re por ted on last March e vent
 The stu dent firms fa ir
 Okay
 The re is a sha red Go og le look hu man, which yo u pro bably know from pre vi ous Mon day Se minars, and the re is two links whe re yo u can se e also the tran sla ti ons, not only in the tran scripts, and yo u can cho o se the tar get lan gu a ges
 The re was o ne spe a ker also with that we a re
 We a re like we
 We put the Mi ke to not only the stu dents
 The much sa id," lod ging the check Gm is e cono mist
 And yo u se e that it is the the the old system wor ked pretty well, in clu ding o ur check tran sla ti ons
 So he was spe a king, and it was re cog ni zing him
 It was re cog ni zing sen ten ces
 So for a bo ut mi nute, we have the per fect show
 And that was it from thre e days
 We had like o ne mi nute
 I be li e ve Hin di, is also a mong also a mong the tar get lan gu a ges
 So what we star ted blog ging
 And and we we block a bo ut all o ur suc ces ses
 The on o ur Web Pa ge
 Blog ging is fun, and so on so on
 So with blog ging
 Yo u im me di a tely feel fa mo us
 It does not re ally mat ter
 If any o ne fol lows yo u, just the fact that yo u pos ted so mew he re that  that ma kes yo u feel fa mo us, and yo u can also so meti mes im pro ve the re ally to have it
 So the the uh, well, we do not do for a shop ping of o ur
 So the re will be u se some in ten ti on jo kes du ring the pre sen ta ti on, and the re will be many u nin ten ti o nal ones in the sub tit les
 Most of the only thing is what we do is we se lec ted the ba tes
 The word" wor ked" so have from tho se to day e vents
 It was o ne mi nute, and but we a re go ing to big ger
 So so ho pefully the re will be al most al most 50 mi nutes of to day, which will be sub tit led" Thro ug ho ut the who le ses si on
 So I said that the be gin ning as a re an empty
 The se a re per fect tec hno logi es
 They work we re
 Well, they a re su per hu man
 Yo u just plug them to get her
 Well, it is not qu i te like that to o
 Ple a se do not la ugh to o lo ud
 Yo u still need to ac qu i re the so und to, yo u need to get the in put, and yo u need to pri son, the o ut put
 And the re is also the lit ter clash
 The spe ech took me to re cog ni ze his words, but we a re re ady to tran sla te sen ten ces
 So what yo u need to do is yo u need to seg ment
 That is thre e more for it is into sen ten ces
 And then only then yo u can tran sla te them  so that ac tu ally that ac tu ally still re qu i res yo u to to add o ne more com po nents, some some seg men ter seg men ta ti on wor ker, and yo u also need to ship all the se bits of tho se thre e him to the va ri ous wor kers a long the pi peli ne
 So the the two stem, just put the two steps to get her set up
 This is ac tu ally this this com pli cated
 So this is the or ar chi tec tu re
 We we know what is a peer Inc, the re
 It is bu ilds upon so met hing which her was de velo ped in in the pre vi ous pro ject
 It is cal led the pa radi se plat form
 And to the se com po nents, all the se com po nents of spe ech re cog ni ti on, and all all that con nects to the cen tral po int call the me di a tor, and yo u have a cli ent that climb co mics to that me di a tor  the muddy, the ir ships it
 So the a ce a re then to seg ment sen ten ce, seg men ter den tal mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 And then to pre sen ta ti on  in the pre sen ta ti on de livers it to the vet  and have we just re ce i ve like con fir ma ti on that this sin gle word
 This se cond of so und was pro cess the a long the who le pi peli ne  But that is that is life that is work in prog ress
 so this
 And this is the runs ac ross the Eu rope
 So some of the se com po nents on here in this bu il ding
 So me of them run so mew he re in the clo ud of pa ir wi se
 So me run in Edin burgh, some run ning cars thro ugh it
 So that is is is this thro ugh be auty  to the con nec ti ons a re al ways o pen, and the re u se ac ross the cli ents a bo ut it thro ugh a re uses o ne par tic le type of Inter net com mu nica ti on that the se Cp pro tocol
 And that re qu i res that the net work is is very bro ad in in the con nec ti on
 So that it
 It does not go col lect any de lay
 So to day
 Any like this is the set up
 That also in clu des the wi ring
 So yo u need to like cal ling the the mac hi nes that the mic rop ho nes and and cun ning, the pri son, think system to the scre en, and all that
 And this is the set of for the year cycle grows whe re the re is six in ter pret this bo oth in all the Mary is on the many sick to all the six lan gu a ges that tho ugh that hu mans in ter pret in to
 And the re we a re col lec ting all tho se then and cho o sing which o ne of them to tran sla te from and then tran sla te to all the re ma i ning 30, so met hing lan gu a ges
 So the set of this a re com pli cated
 This is the wor kers con nec ted to the me di a plat form, and yo u se e that some of them a re busy and some of them a re a va i lab le
 So this, this is like a big in fras truc tu re
 So let us start with some of the is su es ob vi ously the net work and slow things down
 So once we face is the fact that in Con sul whe re the re was some con struc ti on or wha tever
 I wo uld like to bri efly dis cuss the dif fe ren ces bet we en mis si on physi ci ans po ker in which tran sla ti on
 For some re a son, the Uni ver sity had lit tle slo wer Inter net ac cess and that de lay ed all o ur pro ces sing
 So lit tle im me di a tely, we were not li ve
 But we were like se cond sword, do zens of se cond tho ughts la ter than the sig nal
 So yo u yo u sho uld be ac tu ally on sta ge or it very clo se to the ve nu e
 If yo u want to de liver so mew hat in the spe ech re li ably  for debts that this is not prob lem
 But if yo u wan ted to do it life yo u yo u
 Yo u sho uld not rely on on the Inter net
 And this was the prob lem
 And then o ur sum ma rize the am bi ti on that o ur pro ject has ah, a inch, be ca u se the am bi ti on is is high
 And the best of Frock AI, is ses si on whe re I have tes ted e ver ything  it 
Wor ked per fectly for the de mo
 Uh, un for tu nately, even like I have lost a month be fore hand
 And then for se cond ti me, I was not al lo wed to con duct my mac hi ne to ol
 Wi red con nec ti on
 I had to rely on why fight
 And e ver ything wor ked twi ce when was at the ve nu e at this that it
 Then the a u di en ce came and the a u di en ce bro ad the ir cell pho nes
 No body ac tu ally u se the Inter net
 The the cell pho nes were just trying to like look a ro und is the re any in ter nal a va i lab le, and they tri ed to con nect
 We know it
 And and may be just the se tests simply kill the wi fe
 Why? And it did not work for me, and also  on not hing was ever re cog ni zed that even for me
 So
 So we must not rely on wire wi reless con nec ti on
 Then we also had is su es whe re e ver ything went well, ex cept the the the the fi nal pre sen ta ti on was like of fil ling buf fers off web brow sers
 So
 It was not sho wing pro perly on the end user de vice
 It is e ver ything was OK un til the fi nal pre sen ta ti on po int
 And
 Yo u that is
 We a re on a num ber of tests ses si ons
 This is a not her
 This is like miss con fi gura ti on ever like if your jug gling with with the set up
 So it is easy to make mis ta ke
 So in o ne of the ses si ons
 We were ob ser ving some hor rib le
 The lady ga i ning a re gro wing
 And the re a son was that we a re in o ur own so lar system, be ca u se we a re also ex pe rimen ting with that
 And we ren ted lo cally a bo ut ac ci den tally
 We were first sen ding the so und or vi a fight to Italy, and then sen ding in the bank to o ur pla ce to re cog ni ze it
 And only then we we a re
 And this is ac tu ally o ne of the test ses si ons as well
 We a re re cog ni zing it
 So this do ub le do ub le net work low to has kil led that has ca u sed the de lay  next time we
 We wo uld like to re cog ni ze it on the spot
 And and the the prob lem was gone  a ga in
 Now, so und ac qu i siti on
 Yo u may re cog ni ze some of uh, o ne of o ur col le a gu es he re
 And the prob lem is if if yo u have this mic rop ho ne that just mic rop ho ne, and yo u put it he re
 And then yo u talk to the sli ce like that
 The mic rop ho ne does not re ally get your ways
 So af ter the sum mary of the test ses si ons that that we a re ta king part in
 So that is that is o ne prob lem
 This is a not her thing right now
 I wo uld un tru e to un for tu nate
 We had to switch off this just Mi ke num ber lying on this mo uth
 Mi ke, we wan ted to ex tend this test
 So ba sed on a thre e mi nutes of thus tes ting the er ror in re cog ni zing English, and check is of u se se veral po ints, the lo wer
 If yo u u se the mo uth mic rop ho ne com pa red to the chest mic rop ho ne
 So they a re just dis tan ce from the mo uth and the mo vement of the head that ma kes the me a surab le me a surab le dif fe ren ce
 So we a re rel ying on the on the bet ter on the head mic rop ho ne  in this pa per for sin gers
 I will bri efly sum ma rize the old ar chi tec tu re
 So for vo calists
 The yo u have to hold the Mi ke pro perly
 Yo u have yo u have not the vi ew
 Yo u must not put it in your mo uth
 Almost, yo u must not put it to o far away from your mo uth
 And al so, if yo u stand in front of the lo ud spe a kers, the re ver be rati ons, will will to tally kill the sig nal that yo u a re re ce i ving thro ugh my
 So this is what has hap pe ned to us du ring the uh, the stu dent from first o ne, the stu dents were were just ro a ming a ro und,  and they and the the area in front of the lo ud spe a kers
 And sud denly the re was no way to to re cog ni ze them OK and
 Then the va ri ous cab les
 And then I will go a long all the pos sib le is su es of all the e ver ything that can go wrong
 Yo u, have to plug the cab les pro perly
 And o ne of the set tings in the of the con fe ren ce in room for the in ter pre ters
 We were able to get the sig nal
 Only when o ne of the con nec tors
 He re was not fully plug ged in
 The re a son is that we were like mi susing, the the con nec ti ons
 So
 Once once we bro ught a pro per so und card
 It was able to re cog ni se which, been of that the, con duc tor has want, but, with the pro per, some col le ges', the bu il ding some kind of stan dard no tebo ok
 Yo u have to like Miss a lig n
The the pin ce a re all that con nec ted to it to get the sig nal
 So so the the re was an hour or two of de bug ging un til we fi gure o ut how to con nect the in put
 So that is we a re le ar ning
 So then the re is the vo lume set ting a long the a long the pi peli ne
 So
 If yo u have a wi reless mic rop ho ne
 And that is why the re is a long long list of things that that can go wrong
 It has a re ce i ver, and the re is vo lume can throw the re ce i ver, and then yo u have a so und card, and that also has some blue con trol
 And it also has some bar ton, like two but tons
 So line le vel, or make le vel that is o ne but ton and put ting on or off
 So yo u have to that is like four op ti ons, at le ast just for the but tons, and then for the for the for the knobs, and yo u have to the said this
 So this pro perly
 Other wi se
 The so und can be the qu iet, or the so und will be to o to o high
 If the the vo lume wo uld be to o high, and so me o ne a long the pi peli ne will cle ar bit
 And then yo u do not get the fre qu ent fre qu en ci es, and the ears a re what will not work
 So yo u need to ca refully thre ad this sig nal step
 By step ex pe ri en ce
 Pe op le know
 I re mem ber the the good col le a gu e from the pa per was com pany who came for the stu dent fa res have for the first ti me
 And the re we still were strug gling with get ting the sig nal, right? And luck ily, things to the num ber of in ver si ons that we a re trying this list of er rors
 And he like fol low thro ugh on the Mi ke with the he ad pho nes al ways con nec ted as pho nes
 And and that OK it
 Is good he re
 Is good he re, and
 And step by step
 He ma naged to de liver the the right vo lume to the mac hi ne
 So that is yo u have to do
 It is the pri ce, and it can fail at any po int
 Yep
 So then it is o ur qu a lity
 So once yo u have de live red the pos sib le the best pos sib le sig nal
 What does the mis si on re cog ni ze from that
 So this is an e xam ple from the from the stu dent, the high scho ol stu dents
 They ha ve
 The spe a ker wan ted to say so met hing like yo u have a boat to, Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in the harsh in the he art of just go od
 Wo uld yo u know it is
 But in the re ally did
 This is high scho ol stu dent
 So he sa id," yo u have a bot tle
 Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in he art of just get rid of it, so that the re was se ri ous miss pro nun ci a ti on
 And the re was also high le vel of bac kgro und no i se, be ca u se that is fa ir
 So the re is the stands with mu sic play ing in
 It is is so low on the er rors that res pond on
 We a re just be hind a lit tle a lit tle wall,  a ho ping to get
 So me some shows a re from from all that ni ce
 So if yo u a re an ex pert, if yo u a re a per son
And yo u a re in this here in this in this harsh con di ti on s
Then yo u a re pro bably un der stand so met hing  like yo u have a bot tle, be ca u se yo u a re not ex pec ting the the stu dent to talk a bo ut a hold on the bo at
 Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in the he art of all
 And then he wo uld re cog ni ze that some ci ti es be ing men ti o ned
 But if he is from Spa in, he wo uld not know that just they wo uld
 Yo u know, is a is a is a check city
 This thun de red a us o ur Lord de liver so met hing li ke, Oh, yes, the the of the that is the the few words of his he art and sport in the in the no i se sig nal  is the a 's star is its no i se re sis tant
 If it can so mehow can cel led the no i se
 Then it will do so met hing  yo u have so mebody to Oh, yes, we a re si tu a ted in hard, which is can we do, be ca u se it does not know the the name of that ta kes it in
 And if we have a fu ture as o ur or a per son in the in the mid dle ac tu ally, and then we wo uld get the the pro per re cog ni ti on of the sen ten ce
 Every new si milar in stan ce, is is not gro wing much
 So this is a
 This is all the prob lems that that we a re fa cing when we a re trying to tran scri be and non na tive spe a kers
 This is sum mary oc curs the re cor dings that we may have made the ir
 So re mem ber, the word" er ror" rate for hu mans is a ro und six or four per cent  he re, the Go og le system, Go og le, as o ur head er ror rate of of nine dish
 Edin burgh system also show and car also system was ac tu ally the best o ne a ro und 40 still ten ti mes wor se than the was the hu mans do
 And this is this is on the re cor dings were all the systems have pro duced any o ut put what so e ver
 If we apply if we if pe op le have the same fi gures
 But we fo und a 100 per cent of ot hers as the the the sco re
If no o ut put is de live red them
 Go og le is so much wor se than any im be ra
 So I re mem ber was was bet ter
 It was not like gi ving up 
So fre qu ently,  Car los was still still the best system, but still the the car thro ugh a system is ten ti mes wor se than the hu mans
 And that is then what is re por ted in the li tera ture
 Obvi ously
 This is hard con di ti ons
 So we still have the er rors
 So this is the gro und, no is non na tive spe a kers
 Well
 We a re not yet qu i te pro fes si on in the re cor ding
 So we just mi salig ned, the mi kes, and pe op le like tho se po ked yo u to o lo ud
 And we did not do
 That was the knobs of pro perly
 So it is it is very harsh con di ti ons
v But this is the the the re ally do that that yo u can get
 So this is the best re cor ding ac cor ding to the as o ur qu a lity, and the re a re things li ke, why do yo u wear tho se
 So high he els  is that
 Why do yo u wear tho se high heat the high he els
 And she de als in the re is no o ne re ally good star, in ste ad of the sto re that de als with the sale of free down fo od, in ste ad of free ti me, fo ot we ar,  or so met hing like that
 So it is it is the to tally wrong
 Ok
 So what is o ur plan gi ven this
 So we a re de fini tely go ing to ret ra in o ur his arm or ders, and I re ally wo uld like to u se non Na tive spe ech cor po ra,  com mon vo i ce by Mo zil la is o ne of this is that that can help
 So let me wel co me yo u
 But luck ily, we a re clo se to se eing the known er rors, which we have some ways, at le ast, in some ca ses, we which we have some ways to fix o kay, and then will sum ma rize and lo cal di rec ti on this
 And we have a not her fall like uh, the thing to do
 We wo uld like to fol low in ter pre ters in ste ad of the flo or, be ca u se each of the in ter pre ter will sit in the bo oth with li mited snow is  from sur ro un dings with bet ter mic rop ho ne
 So we have more con trol of the re cor ding, we can also talk to the in ter pre ters and ex pla in to them  that they a re be ing re cor ded and pro ces sed in par tic le we ight, and we also have the chan ce to a depth of them
 So we a re trying to get the ir con tacts
 We have still few months to co me
 And even if they a re non na tive, we sho uld be able to a depth of the ir par ti cular spe ech
 So we wo uld ca u se them to do as the lo ve
 Well, few mi nutes, the mob pos sibly up to an hour of of re cor ding wo uld pay them to what I  read so me
 Thanks to o ur o ur in ter pret so met hing
 And then we were to cre a te a tra i ning data set for that par ti cular per son
 And then ob vi ously, we a re go ing to get her in do ma in data at the so ut hern and re gularly
 Apol lo e ight
 So a ga in, down yo ur
 So does the Sri
 We get the text sown know what, what do we know? What do we ex pect? Now, what that tran sla ti on the re, all the stan dard tran sla ti on er rors that yo u know whe re well
 So here is o ne e xam ple, a sen ten ce, which was ac tu ally re cog ni ze per fectly
 I know which sen ten ces a re re cog ni zed per fectly
 So I know what to a vo id when I 'm run ning demo  of this is also dif fe rent from the from the u sers of o ur system, they will simply is says," spe ak as they a re used to
 If I want to show ca se what o ur system is do ing
 I will a vo id na med en ti ti es
 I will a vo id stran ge con struc ti ons
 I will have like thro ugh and thro ugh new spa per, like a style of sen ten ces, and then all the all the systems will suc ces sfully or ga nized me
 So this is o ne of the the ca ses
 But it is much more dif fi cult to to ask if yo u do not have any clu e, and yet, the tran sla ti ons, both into Ger man,  and check ed to sam ple lan gu a ges were wrong
 The if was tran sla ted as all pow, 'rs dock, um
 So it wo uld come e arly de man ded tests
 And that is that black dis torts the this to wards the the sen se of of that
 So might gu ess is that may be in English, yo u wo uld in in Na tive English
 Yo u wo uld ac tu ally say this a lit tle bit dif fe rently
 And then the re might be more ex pli cit clue in the so ur ce
And then I 'm not say ing that the sen ten ce in English is wrong
  I 'm say ing that in de ed tra i ning da ta, which is from news or may be bo oks, or or or yo u have le gis la ti on
 Men
 The re is this sli de do ma in
 Is much any even even if it is not do ma in mis match
 This is is ge nerally am bi gu ous con jun cti on, and it is dif fi cult for the mac hi ne to gu ess the me a ning
 So if yo u a re clo ser to the tra i ning da ta, then yo u will se e it will work bet ter
 If if it is a dif fi cult, an am bi gu ous ex pres si on
 Yo u will have the se prob lems mo ved to flo at like for ever yet
 He re is some some just mi sun der stan ding or well, as the it was o ut of wor k
Every the mis si on tran sla ti on system,  That is whe re yo u can se e the sub tit les
 Ra nald Hun gary, yo u can be re por ted af ter some pro fani ti es
 So if yo u if yo u say so met hing bad on your web si te, then they will flow like bo ok, yo u know
 And that was the most tran sla ted as pro fes si o nal thinks  that is be ca u se of the prop het is, we a re not in the in the book of very of the mis si on tran sla ti on system
 So the re sor ted to sup port ex pres si ons
 Okay, ah, the prob lem in spo ken English tran sla ti on is that the ants a re He i ress
 Get kind of mul tip li ed in mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 If yo u have an er ror in spe ech re cog ni ti on
 Then the er ror will be a few e dits a sin gle word si milar in sha pe the what I have set
 But then yo u take this sin gle word and yo u tran sla ted, and then the sha pe of the word" like the to tally chan ges
"  So mac hi ne tran sla ti on ta kes all the wrong words
 From the ears a re as full of thrust forth and need hap pily re al 
The re is a sen ten ce to make it  Okay, ah, we have been wor king
 the best pos sib le sen ten ce, in clu ding tho se strong words, and the re is no in for ma ti on a bo ut the con fi den ce, ne it her from this ar tist them,  nor from the Mis si on fo un da ti on system
 So the so the user will be just left with the sen ten ce, which so unds per fectly na tural love men ti on some French en ti ti es,  which were ne ver ne ver men ti on ne ver part of the dog, be ca u se they co me
 They come from an er ror
 So here is an e xam ple
 And the goal of my fe es
 This is to fold, and the re was two fold
 So in ste ad of two fold
 This a re good as this to fa ult, that is the na tural like miss re cog ni ti on of the empty o ut put was
 And the goal of my the ory is that of the se is is to fall a part
 So the re is de fini tely not what what we were af ter in this is that so that yet
 So this is
 This is what I wo uld pro bably tran sla te the dow nsi de it to o
 If I was the o ne thing a bo ut
 I just wan ted to hig hlight this to fold to miss re cog ni zed
 This two fold was tran sla ted as well as the bits that to fall a part
 We as the De par tment have been wor king on mac hi ne tran sla ti on, for many ye ars, or de cays ac tu ally, a in 't it
 And that is to tally o ut of o ut of the sco pe
 Ok
 So what we ha ve, what what is o ur plan for the mis si on tran sla ti on, da ta, data da ta, and then may be lit tle bit of mo dels
 So we a re de fini tely go ing to get her more cal led a dump
 And in the u niver se that num ber is wor king on that
 We a re go ing to get the more tar gets, si de, mo nolin gu al data and make them sla te that is for the do ma in a dap ta ti ons
 So this is al re ady think do ma in
 So we wo uld like like yo u to fo cus on all the se ma teri als
 	They a re hardly Pa o lo
 So me of them a re, but not to o many, and es pe ci ally not for tho se like 19, no new lan gu a ges that we a re also na ming it
 So ho pefully o ur ba seli ne systems in the back tran sla ti on will make some sen sib le o ut put from that, and ho pefully will be able  to im pro ve the vast i nequ a lity  will cre a te in do ma in test sets, and we re gularly able wait on them
 We also tri ed to get in to uch with the ho u se
 Aga in
 That is the col lec ti on of the user sup pli ed  When yo u say mac hi ne tran sla ti on

 So to sum up like fil te ring off off lar ger pool of Apol lo da ta
 We a re also trying to cre a te gu ess the te ars so lace to ug her live on men into the se like par ti cipants, or or the pre sidents of the Sup re me a u dit of fi ce says,"  this is ha ving just the list of na mes
It is not i de al for for ma ti on tran sla ti on
 What is that re ally bet ter than not hing
 So we will
 We will try this as well
 I 'm also con si dering

 I 'm con si dering to to tra in mac hi ne tran sla ti on on dis tor ted so ur ce,  be ca u se I wo uld pre fer
 The mis si on was, this is them to say so met hing in the do ma in and sen sib le rat her than to ah, to like  try to who and per fectly tran sla te the wrong way us o ur o ut put
 So for me, it ten ta tively
 I 'm say ing that uh, it se ems to be bet ter to say so met hing si milar or re lated  to re ad
 The Den is the like do per fect os cil la ti on of the wrong im port
 We might mean text tran sla ti on
 They will se e whet her this is good as sum pti on, or not, if if the system starts ma king up the con tent
 Then ob vi ously, the u sers will not be happy as well
 But right now,  o ur system is to o easy to to like that that that the that it is to o easy to to note is that o ur system is do ing so met hing wrong,  and we want to hi de
 It is a bit un der the car pet
 So let us se e if this will be a good stra tegy or not
 And let us se e if we ma nage to tra in such a mo tor,  and I 'm af ra id that we will ne ver get she du ring this few months to the in te res ting things like this, this be ca u se gen der
 Obvi ous ly
The mac hi ne tran sla ti on system has no in for ma ti on a bo ut the gen der of the spe ech,  the Pall
 They wo uld have to his sto od to tally like Mo on, Non la beled to ha ve
 It does not know a bo ut that 
Thank yo u
 And no new English does not mark a most sen ten ces for the gen der of the spe a ker
 And the re the im port a re sen ten ces, which a re, which a re al most al ways gram ma tically," cor rect, and they may come in do cuments
 So it is very li kely that o ur system will be just ma king up and swit ching the gen der of the of the spe a ker in the first per son sen ten ces,  and that will be very con fu sing for the a u di en ce
 So well, I 'm af ra id that we will not get to this, un less the re is so me o ne who wo uld like to o kay
 Then the in teg ra ti on of the a ce a re an empty of or der set s R
M it is the rings off,  lo wer ca se words, mis si on tran si ti on ex pects in di vidu al co u ric sen ten ces
 So the re a re num ber of op ti ons that we can try to brid ge the gap
 So we can try to in the ir pun ctu a ti on into the as o ur o ut put, which we call the seg men ter, or we can chan ge the as sor row to pre dica te di rectly  co u ric, pun ctu a ti on
 So the spe ech re cog ni ti on with the run not into just se qu en ce of fo rests, but se qu en ce of words with pun ctu a ti on and  ca pita liza ti on plan
 A stu dent of mine is is wor king on this
 And we can also try so met hing which is o ne of the re se arch ghosts of o ur pro ject  that is for the end to end spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on with o ne ne u ral system that re ally gets the so und in o ne lan gu a ge and pro duces  So yo u may have some con tent, some con text sur ro un ding the sen ten ces, or yo u might also so meti mes by sen ten ce
 the tran sla ti on in the in the tar get lan gu a ge right a way
 So that is a ga in part of Pe ter 's the sis
 So the seg men ter gi ven us thre e or fo ur
 It is gets pun ctu a ti on ca sing
 Co uld we u se the ot her car stilts, ah, to ol, so me, so so me o ne sto ol
 Unfor tu nately, the spe ech in for ma ti on is no lon ger ac ces sib le to this to ol
 So it has just the se qu en ce of words

 It is gu es sing sen ten ce bo un da ri es

 A dis co ur se spe ci a lists sa id," The is ac tu ally do ing very good job gi ven  that it does not have any in for ma ti on a bo ut the pa u ses of all the in for ma ti on
 So it is sur pri sing how well it can pre dict the sen ten ce bo un da ri es  with this the poor in for ma ti on
 So still, it is it is far from per fect
 So the re a re many er rors
 And the re is also a not her to which the war to con si der the in to nati on and and de lays, but we have not had time to in teg ra ted
 So if so me o ne wo uld like to play a ro und with that wo uld be happy to it till we get to an yhow the re
 So it was sunk
 It sug gests rain this, this seg ment or tool on ching da ta, both four mil li on sen ten ces
 And here is the Pre cisi ans and re calls for va ri ous pun ctu a ti on mar gins
 We a re in ser ting and how hig hlig hting the re call of  And the first ses si on of the spring tur ned off se ven, not a o ne to se ven
 But it is de fini tely like so meti mes ba sed in spo ken English tran sla ti on
 pe ri od, be ca u se that is cri tical to to i den tify sen ten ce bo un da ri es
 So it is 70 to a to a two per cent, which is re a sonab le,  if yo u look at it as a num ber, but it is still far from suf fi ci ent for prac ti cal u se
 Okay
 So here is an e xam ple of an er ror in in the us
 In the seg men ta ti on so He i ress, im pre cisi on, only two con fu sing empty o ut put
 So he re, the spe a ker sa id," so met hing like all to o
 Well, that was part of a lon ger lon ger phra se,  and the us a re plus seg men ter, but put a full stop bet we en this lake in the mid dle of this phra se," re li e ving to the o ut put
 This ap pro ach does not ge nera lize all to o and then se para te sen ten ce
 Well, so to so mehow con clu de that the who le talk
 So here the se man tics is ob vi ously chan ged qu i te bit
 This is e xactly the case whe re the mac hi ne tran sla ti on wo uld burst o ne by o ne re ce i ved the first sen ten ce,  and then the se cond sen ten ce, and it wo uld have no way to re cover from a from the full stall, which sho uld not be the re in the first pla ce
 So the re to to sen ten ce
 This wo uld get like be au tiful, but the the the mes sa ge wo uld be dis tor ted er rors in the re call, ah,  make to o much con tent, un stab le, and will ex pla in this on on on the fol lo wing flights
 The in put is so und
 So here is a not her tec hni cal think uh, the the mes sa ging bet we en the spe ech re cog ni ti on and spo ke English tran sla ti on
 So it is if it is the on li ne spe ech re cog ni ti on
 We a re re ce i ving text mes sa ges a bo ut this text mes sa ges
 Offspring was off
 Words  a re not re lated to sen ten ce bo un da ri es
 So in the first run
 And this is what we what we were mostly se eing in in March, or that is all  the ses si ons that the word of tests for for the Sup re me, what of fi ce
 We were re ce i ving the se mes sa ges
 So
 This is the first mes sa ge, the se cond mes sa ge, third mes sa ge and 4th mes sa ge, and we were di rectly sen ding the se mes sa ges  to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 So the first mes sa ge was yo u sho uld think the re have be en, and they a re
 They a re still un fi nis hed
 Invents  mac hi ne tran sla ti on system
 Gi ven this im plo de de cided to to tally on with the first sen ten ce, be ca u se the first, and then like  does not fe ed
 The ir mis si on tran si ti on system is tra i ned to tran sla te fal se and then ce into full sen ten ce
 So some half sen ten ce  he re
 Let us drop it
 So it is said to just Dick
 We just think, yo u know, and then the law
 This is an ex ten si on of that mes sa ge
 So the is o ur sent a ga in, the same pre fix
 And then it en ded the ex tra words that came in the me an ti me
 And the o ut put is text
 And this is pro bably the best tran sla ti on that the empty co uld have de live red for that, and then the his hor se and so met hing which we call  the con fir ma ti on mes sa ge
 So the is o ur says," well, I will not bot her with the se thre e words an ymo re
 Yo u sho uld think I will just lo ve
 I 'm Phil fi nali zing the se
 And from now on, I will only send yo u the rest
 The re have been many re volu ti ons
 So here is a sin gle mes sa ge
 Yo u sho uld think
 So that is o ne com ple te sen ten ce
 And the be gin ning of a not her sen ten ce, and we have  tran sla ted as as if it was on ce
 And and that is that is just wrong, and then the next mes sa ge stars in the mid dle of the sen ten ce al re ady
 And we a re a ga in fe e ding it as if it was a com ple te sen se
 And so the re is like the sen ten ce bo un da ri es a re to tally u nob ser ved by o ur ap pro ach,  and that that kills e ver ything, and it e mits it
 It is um gre ats all of the se par ti al sen ten ces into full sen ten ces
 But that is not re lated to the  the the what the what the pe op le sa id," OK so
 If yo u put to get her the the as sor row and the bet ter
 And we did it in mo ti on on the fol lo wing si ze,  then yo u still need to Pre sident so mehow the re sult
 So that is whe re it is slowly co ming to wards the the fi nal sta ge, and still,  it can to tally kill the the show
 Ah, this
 If yo u have fo und two small, such as in the sub tit les, if they were a lit tle bit smal ler it
  We will get to some more de ta ils a bo ut
 They will not be of any u se for yo u at all
 So yo u need to very ca refully ba lan ce like how much con tent yo u put to so mew he re
 And if the pho ne wo uld be e ligib le
 If it is still, if it is le gib le for pe op le in the first row
And for the pe op le in the last thro ugh  if they have to rely on the cell pho ne
 And sud denly they have a dif fe rent sha pe sha pe, dif fe rent rec tan gu lar area whe re the tran sla ti ons  and tran scrip ti ons
Abby
And this he a vily af fects how much in for ma ti on we can send for them, and we have to dyna mically de cide what what the sent them
 And and what not the, for e xam ple
 Then if if if this text, flick ers to o much
 If the worst chan ge to o qu ickly
 Yo u can thre e them
 So that is o ne of the re a sons why we have not em ploy ed the fully ne u ral net work as o ur system so far, be ca u se they a re tra i ned  to o pera te on win dow that mo ves in ti me
 So uh, e ight se conds at o ne go a re al ways re cog ni zed, and the be gin ning can chan ge
 So i magi ne e ight se conds of my spe ech bank, and still like a Re ed de ciding what is the first word, as mostly the words do not chan ge,  but so meti mes they do
 And if yo u have this long pi e ce of text, and the like swaps that he re
 And the re ah, the re and back on on va ri ous pla ces
 In va ri ous worst
 Yo u do not know how to fol low that
 It is it is like on stab le text
 So we a re wor king on this on this in teg ra ti on
 What does this text, but sen ten ces, some may or may not be pro duce, then ac tu ally them so meti mes sho uld not be as su med at all
 And I wan ted to hig hlight
 This pre sen ta ti on must be tes ted on sta ge
 Yo u can have tes ted in si mula ti on, like good that the si zing of that day, as the vi sibi lity from va ri ous a re as that all can kill
 It can ne gati vely af fec ted in such way that  it is not u sab le at all
 If yo u have ever or der so met hing from any shop, and it ca me, but it was like the wrong si ze
 I that to smal ler to o big
 Then, yo u know what I 'm tal king a bo ut a in an is su e up
 Yo u have a pic tu re of what yo u a re buy ing
 But the pic tu re is o ut of pro por ti on
 If yo u do not know, if yo u a re get ting this big that it bet ter, or or this tiny that bear the so it is it can be or have the wrong si ze,  and that the same thing as here for or for the sub tit les
 So here is o ne of the vi ews that yo u have be en
 May be yo u have been wat ching on your mac hi nes
 This is ma inly for show ca sing that we can a ro und the tran sla ti on into many tar get lan gu a ges
 So we a re sho wing two li nes of sub tit les in then lan gu a ges, the mo ment, and this will be 40 43
 This is good to de mon stra te that the system is fol lo wing me, and it can cre a te the fall slowly po siti ve im pres si on, be ca u se  if yo u a re fol lo wing me any, if yo u un der stand my my my lan gu a ge
 Then yo u can not do
 Yo u can no lon ger read ca refully
 What is in the in the sub tit les,  So may be what we all know that we do not spe ak in sen ten ces and fi guring o ut whe re the sen ten ce
 and yo u were only ob ser ved the right, key words the re
 So if I say so met hing a bo ut sub tit les, then yo u will se e to to look in check than yo u will no tice  a low gra de
 The system is re cog ni zing this per son, but yo u a re not able to jud ge the qu a lity of the sen ten ces
 So the sen ten ces, in fact, a re pretty crappy, and they jump to qu ickly
 And if yo u if yo u did not un der stand me
 And yo u only had the se two li nes to fol low
 Then yo u wo uld get lost in the er rors of as a re empty
 So this is
 This is good to show off, but it is bet ter for the u se of
 So we have so met hing el se
 We also show much lon ger con text
 So the is that X is a gross
 And here yo u have a no
 This was pro bably gi ven in English
 And then it was tran sla ted into a check and Ger man
 And he al re ady se e the dif fe ren ce bet we en the stab le o ut put, the par ti al o ut put  and the like the in co ming o ut put
 So
 So me of the se sen ten ces a re fully pro ces sed by all the pi peli ne of all the com po nents in the pi peli ne
 And the re is no way they co uld be up da ted any lon ger
 And the se sen ten ces a re shown in a re shown in black, and then the ir sen ten ces,  which a re gra du ally be ing up da ted
 And here still the pun ctu a ti on can can like make a dif fe ren ce
 So that is why we a re sho wing this only in gre at
 And then the re is the last sen ten ce, which is still get ting more and more words, and as the seg men ter fi nis hes pro ces sing of some of this
 And this is a dif fi cult part
 And then the 4th some full stop
 He re will ap pe ar
 And it will be o ut of the uh, the pro ces sing area of of the seg ment the re an ymo re, and it will be come  the black and full of stab le o ut put
 He re yo u se e in the Y
 The full stop re call is im por tant
 If the full stop a re to o scars the re to o in fre qu ent  in the o ut put
 Then to o much of text will re ma in in this gray face and do much of tics will like be still un de cided in flick e ring,  pe op le will wait wait to o long for the stab le o ut put
 And yo u also that it is also like mat ter of tas te, whet her pe op le wo uld like to fol low the more  the more un stab le Ma u rice and o ut put, or whet her they wo uld like to have full only the stab le o ne, but be se veral se conds be hind the spe a ker,  so that the dif fe ren ce
 So this is so met hing that we have to up da te
 And i de ally, it wo uld be the u sers cho i ce
 Wo uld yo u like to have the the the shor test pos sib le de lay at the risk of fi ce, the re a ding so met hing which will be still like fi xed,  or wo uld yo u like to wait lit tle lon ger un til o ur o ut put is stab le
 So that is so met hing that the the i de ally, the the user wo uld cho o se  who, so if pe op le a re pro vided with this lon ger con text, then they can bet ter re cover from er rors a long the bike li ne
 So it is al most im pos sib le to fol low the con tent of a dog, which is not known to yo u
If it is not to o far from the do ma in of the tra i ning of the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system
 So that is the re
 Ah, a ga in, and yet
And so here is a lit tle sum mary of what has to be do ne
 If yo u a re pre sen ting checks only in the two li nes of sup pli ed link
 So yo u have some this a re
 So this is some English has thre e or four words, pi xels on your scre en
At any gi ven mo ment
It is also very fle xib le
 Archi tec tu re of this is an en ti re bo ok
 So yo u se e that the re is no as sent and bo un da ri es
 And the seg men ter ne eds to pre dict some sen ten ce bo un da ri es  so ap
 It is pre dic ted a full stop here and a full stop he re
And then some is o ur de bate co mes
And it also ba sed on this day, the seg men ter has  a not her up da te
 So it pre dicts o ne more full stop he re
 So this is like a se qu en ce is self up da tes co ming
 And some of the se sen ten ces a re al re ady  com ple ted
 So the seg men ter says," this full stop this fi nal
 I will ne ver ne ver take it back do with this sen ten ce, wha tever yo u li ke, will not to uch it to them
 So me of the se
 So me of the se for ce of a re still un stab le
 So I 'm a a re move this full stop, and I mo ved slightly
 And then we also have to  to like han dle that pro perly
And then as the Us
And the res t
The last sen ten ce is only Qs ex pec ted or in co ming like we do not know what what the sen ten ce
 What will fi nish like we a re sen ding now full sen ten ces to the mac hi ne tran sla ti on system 
So that is the the the re is like who go od
 Now
 That me ans  that the
And this is them his brow of fed with the in put is re ady for 
So now, go ing into Ger man
It will say," let us that so met hing like  The re will be some pen si on
 picks them all fre e dom 
Bill show him that su i ted him tight bo om, co uld as sist all
I know is that fle xib le he retics, or as it is
 So
 So this ma kes this ma kes sen se
 This is like Co u ric jud gment, and then says," The is su e is how much spa ce yo u have to show this Ger man to u se it
 So if we have two li nes of sub tit les that, wo uld that wo uld show this yel low part and this yel low part
And then, be ca u se the last sen ten ce got  some ex tra words
It got ex ten ded, the the the system de cided to chan ge the be gin ning of of this sen ten ce them 
They de cided to chan ge the last word  on the first sub tit le li ne
If the lime this like still vi sib le
 We can e a sily do the chan ge
And not hing bad hap pens
If we a re li mited to just o ne line of sub tit le  o ut put 
Then this line has been al re ady rol led o ut like the the the the user can no lon ger seed the u ser, so it a se cond a go
 But now this is no  lon ger ac ces sib le
 So we wo uld have to show the like only half of the sen ten ce, and that is so met hing that we can not do
 So the so met hing has chan ged
 We call this
 The rest sa id," now, the now the se sub 
Tig hte ning mec ha nism has to go back and show so met hing which has or disc rol led up and show it a ga in
 So that is the user can re ad 
But this thre e sa id," is ex tre mely an noy in g
So yo u may have no ticed no ticed that so meti mes this 
The sub tit les got  the right
 And the the wretch ef fect is e xactly hig hlig hting ar res ted has hap pe ned 
So the the the seg men ter 
The se cond, most os cil la ting like whe re  When when my put ting the se two com po nents to get her, the spe ech re cog ni ti on and the mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 to put some of the full stops were to put the ah, the ca sing chan ges and gave the chan ge of the full stop, or the ca sing hap pe ned a bove the edge in  the li ne, which al re ady rol led up 
Then the sub tit le, even put here for a us a re is su ed ar res ted, and it also in di cated in red 
So the red for me
 It was like re mote
 Yes
 This is the rest
 So this is the this is the case whe re the sub tit les had to scroll back, be ca u se so met hing was up da ted o ut si de of the scre en,  so the de ad 
But that is an il lus tra ti on of why the li mited o ut will spa ce is so cri tical for de live ring the that tran sla ti on to the u ser,  if yo u li mit yo ur self, to o much, if the lan gu a ge dif fe ren ces, to o big
 And so the wards re or de ring and the length of the sen ten ces of like make yo u  yo u lar ger bits that then fit on the fi nal scre en, then the user will be ex pe ri en cing a very con fu sing re set s
So I 'm like stres sing this, be ca u se this  is so met hin g
This is 
The se a re de cisi ons that yo u make a long the who le pi peli ne
And it is only the very last bit the size of the win dow that kills it, or or ma kes it make it wor kab le
 So that is that is why we a re like fig hting in the con sor ti um 
Why?What is the bet ter o ut put of the
It se ems ba sed on  the se ar gu ments that yo u wo uld de fini tely do not want to have the sub tit le so up 
Yo u pre fer yo u
 Yo u sho uld pre fer the lon ger pa rag raph yo u that that yo u  saw on the pre vi ous sli de
 But the prob lem here is that if yo u if yo u make some very bad mis s
They gave some some bad word of some pro fanity ap pe ars  And it is my ple a sure to come he re, o ne off of a car we eks
 And the re is o ne more area that I wo uld like to just men ti on is cal led" in cre men tal mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 in the o ut put
It will still be the re for to o long
And pe op le like that, they go the ir cell pho nes and and take pic tu res of the Bill that bed we re
 So ah, yo u a re ex po sing to o much of of your prob lems in this that 
So that is why that is why the the some some par tners in the con sor ti um pre fer red  the the sub tit les 
But the re is a big risk of of the sub tit les be ing in com pre hen sib le
 Ok
So then the re is the o verall cog ni tive lo ad, and the the the  o verall u sabi lit y
We have to u ser s
They a re here who corn for him de ad 
So so so no o ne over the re
 The re is many that that is a not her the the stu di es
 So the re is so many u sers who have tri ed to fol low 
This have said that that the re is no way that yo u wo uld be fol lo wing the tran sla ti on on your no tebo ok
 And lo o king at the sli des of the spe a ker, who is in front of yo u, even if it is like in the very clo se an gle
If yo u do not have to move your eyes to o much
 Yo u still have to ac co moda te be ca u se of the dif fe rent dis tan ce, and, that will take some ti me
 And
Then yo u will se e as soon as yo u look up at the sli des
 Yo u will lose the sub tit les, then yo u will lose con ten t
So we a re now wor king on en ding the sli des, but also to the the scre en whe re the sub tit les  ap pe ar, or the ot her way a ro und put ting sub tit les to uh, to the scre en, whe re that with the fli es a re
 So this is so met hing which which has to be do ne
 And then the old u sabi lit y
The o verall u sabi lity is still very bad lo ve
 Invi ting yo u who e ver does not spe ak French, and wo uld like to join us
 And the re, this is mac hi ne tran sla ti on, the re se ar chers do ing that
 We a re
 Ho pefully this we ek, we a re run ning like a French mo vi e wat ching ses si on, or just ten mi nutes of it that dark, we do not spe ak French
 So we will fol low o ur systems, re cog ni zing the French and tran sla ting into English, or or check or any ot her lan gu a ge
 Ain 't it 
We will try to come up  with im pro vements that wo uld make it ac tu ally u sab le be ca u se it is very big dif fe ren ce, whet her yo u can un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge, or or not   o ur 
We had a si milar ses si on with much im pro per pre sen ting so met hing on mac hi ne tran sla ti on, e volu ti on in check any Ross and then did by o ur to   fo re ign stu dents
And the se two fo re ign stu dents re por ted that they co uld fol low the check ed dog, if they fully fo cused on the pa rag raph fu el,   as soon as they lo o ked upon the sli des, they got los t
So if with full at ten ti on to the sli ce
It was pos sib le to fol low it
 But this is not for a nor mal u sers, like nor mally, u se
 Tho se have to yo u have to have some free time for the ir for the ir bra ins as well
 I wo uld like to hig hlight that that 
The se a re set ting dif fers from Hug hes Abu se it 
Tho se who un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge will need the si milar to new Gle e,  and they wo uld pre fer it all or pre cisi on and sta bility, if yo u a re fol lo wing what I 'm say ing," then the
And if yo u a re re a ding the sub tit les in your mot her  tank, then they co uld pro vide yo u with the words that yo u mis sed
If yo u do not un der stand word
It co uld ap pe ar he re
 Yo u wo uld un der stand it,  So they start with the words words that come in sen ten ces, and they just feed the system with the words, but o ne at ti me
 but it has to be the re, and the like on the spot
And at the mo ment, when I said the word, if it is the re a re thre e se con ds
After then yo u, it was of no  u se to yo u any mo re, be ca u se it like yo u have mo ved in what yo u a re lis te ning al re ad y
So if yo u a re fol lo wing the so ur ce lan gu a ge
 The sub tit les in  your Mot her dun can help yo u, but they have to be im me di a te
If yo u do not un der stand the so ur ce lan gu a ge, then yo u a re only rel ying on the text
 And in that ca se, yo u wo uld pre fer stab le it in pre cisi on, and yo u a re happy to wait for se cond ste wed 
Yo u do not know what I 'm tal king a bo ut it all
 So it is not a prob lem
If if yo u get my mes sa ge e ight se conds la ter 
So this is two very dif fe rent u se ca ses
And it sho uld be the user to se lect,  which which of the dis plays is the is that not not just OK so in ha lati on the re
 Are thre e as pects of spo ken English tran sla ti on 
Qu a lity does so met hing  that we know from mac hi ne tran sla ti on
And we know how to have va gu ely es ti mate the tran slu cent qu a lity, but the re is also the la ke
 How much is the text in the tran sla ti on de lay ed be hind the so ur ce of some of the La ke is ob vi ously i nevi tab le, be ca u se yo u have to wait for the Ger man verb, or we have to an ti cipa te it in some way, and the re is flick er 
So
If yo u have a system, which is up da ting, and we have such system s
Then the se  systems can an ti cipa te, and they have the ca pacity to co ring them sel ves 
So then sud denly they can cre a te some o ut put, and then re move it in the next  So the in cre men tal mis si ons
 step
And this has to be con trol led very much so that the user is not con fu se
 So we a re wor king on an e volu ti on to with him an sorry, and hi de ous as as the them, the most se ri ous prob lem
 If yo u have this English, as a re the do
 Yo u know, it is cat is not it 
Yes
It is like that 
So let us i magi ne that the Seg men ter has seg men ted into the se  two chun ks
The re is no way to a lign it 
Well, with this Ger man tran sla ti on, the ir fri ends, be ca u se it has thre e sen ten ces that the do ors a re gro u ped in  a dif fe rent way in the sen ten ces 
So we have to do is so mehow for ce a lign the se
 So that the ba sic set of u nits that we a re ever le a ding over is com mon to all systems, re gar dless of what the English
As o ur do es
Uh, e ver ybody has to re ach the   same re feren ces seg men ta ti on 
So the re is some stra tegi es
I 'm not go ing into the into the bills, any mo re
 Essen ti ally we have the op ti on to   work with the se sen ten ces, un li ke con si der more sen ten ces at the same ti me, or we can to tally for get sen ten ces, and we can ever laid by em ploy ing   30 se conds chun ks
So did the the empty the as so the pi peli ne, the the uh 
So the pi peli ne pro duce the right words wit hin the se 30 se conds
 And if it did then, yes, if not the not 
So this is this is like way to go a ro und the prob lems of sen ten ce, this not be ing o ut the re in in spe ech  at all yet 
So the se arch for the mo bili zati on
As I as I say it 
The bat tle tor so
 Usab le system is still not los t
So we a re now bu il ding of an  army of paid vo lun te ers
And if yo u have any pro col le a gu es or stu dents who can help us bet we en now and may or Ju ne, we a re to tally happy to take them  Oppo siti on is still to at le ast to my know led ge to my un der stan ding is still ta kes the base tran sla ti on
 on bo ar d
So we a re me e ting at le ast once a week for just 30 mi nutes and dis cus sing was wor king on lot, and we have funds for this
 So this is like ah, as a new paid work, and yo u can do many smal lish tas ks
For e xam ple, if yo u a re lo o king at some of the empty o ut puts
 The re co uld have been bad cha rac ters, be ca u se no o ne has yet fly co uld check to whe re they come from in the pi peli ne
 Then the re is lar ger, but the  things that we need to de velop 
We wo uld like to have a as a das hbo ard, which we will give a con fi gura ti on like a life system, run ning which gross locks tho ught look fi les and does that bo ard sho uld loss that im me di a tely se e, whe re is the prob lem
 So for e xam ple, if we a re re cog ni zing the English bo oth with the French, as a re then the re will be many of fri en dship words, co ming from the systems, but they  will be to tally wron g
The re is the the most la ug hab le o ut put
 I have seen so far like swap ping the lan gu a ges for the as a re be ca u se the the system  still strug gle
It will be like says," The word" si milar with pro nun ci a ti on, but in the wrong lan gu a ge, and the sen ten ces will not make any sen se what so e ver
 So this can e a sily hap pen
If yo u a re fol lo wing six im ports and tran sla ting into 43 lan gu a ges 
Yo u need a con ci se view to to to know what your systems  a re do in g
So that wo uld be das hbo ar d
Then a lot of work on that do ma in and spe a ker a dap ta ti on, just just get ting in to uch with all the in ter pret tho se who wo uld be in the bo oth and con duc ting them, as king them to come here re cord an hour e ach
 And then u sing this, they have got to have the system 
Aga in
A lot of a lot of lit tle work co at, swit ching is so met hing which I have not dis cus sed  It just co mes a ward at ti me
 in my talk at al l
But I 'm re a lizing how fre qu ent it is not only in lin gu is tic lec tu res, whe re we have e xam ples in four lan gu a ges,  but also na tive spe a kers of ot her lan gu a ges, the English fre qu ently, but bring in English phra ses, and the as o ur systems a re to tally not re ady for that
 So then the it is very si milar to to a bove the na med ex pres si on or na med
And it is, it is simply an own words that get re cog ni ze into so met hing very, very bad
 And then when this gets tran sla ted is still, the re were la ug hab le
 The re is also a not her ac ti vity, which wo uld re ally like to start call in le at her  clim bin g
So it is when yo u have fi xed tes ted, and your wor king on im pro vements have your mo del of or the pi peli ne
 So your ma king many small chan ges,  and yo u a re al ways o ver lo a ding on that that is that is 
So yo u a re clim bing the le at her of per for man ce
 So this is this is what we have to run a
 I 'm ho ping for like two big ger Mo dal rid 
The ret ra i ning says," un til un til may and many ar chi tec tu re chan ges, many like smal ler fi xes that can im pro ve  the disk or qu i te a bit pa in t
Yo u up for the tal ked a bo ut this 
So the re is the re is bo ard, but it is still so met hing dif fe rent
And they sup port is like tec hni cal
 Uh, set up Yo u want to know that the so und vo lume from all the six im ports
 This is the right was the small, the so ur ce mo nitor 
Yo u as su me that the  tec hni cally the ar chi tec tu re is all set of well, but still, yo u need to de cide which of the as a re in the com bi nati on of the spe a ker works best,  And the re is dif fe rent from the spe ech, which co mes a se cond a di me, like a a bit of so und at a ti me, so that the time is dif fe rent
 and which of the se so ur ces de livers the best tran sla ti on qu a lity into the many tar get lan gu a ges 
So this is like a tec hni cal check that e ver ything is  run ning
And this is se lec ti on of the best pos sib le thro ugh the for the bes t
The o ut put wan ted them to sum ma rize of the ir le a der sub si ding, a is a big  chal len ge for the pro ject, even if yo u con nect to su per hu man com po nen ts
They can still Del hi were crept to get her
 So we a re now wor king on ma king this u sab le, tec hni cally the com plex pi peli ne now works
It has been wor kin g
How many res tart as that yo u have to know do some good mot her
 Okay ?So it is not seem less, but with o ne o pera tor
It can sur vi ve 60 mi nutes of of spe ech and the
 But un for tu nately, even with this who le system, wor king the be nefit for the end user is still li mited or no nexis tent
 So
If yo u did not fol low my English spe ech
If yo u only had chan ce to read the check tran sla ti on
I 'm cu ri ous how much yo u wo uld get
 So this is o ne of the
 We a re tru e
 We have still a few months a go
 So I 'm very lucky that that 
We have the se months to to fix the pi peli ne
 And some of the prob lems that will a re run ning into a re not go ing to be sold in the next two, thre e, five ye ars
 But some of them can be fi xed 
The soul will do o ur best to to make the the the o ut put ac tu ally u sab le,  and she goes to ple a se
 Ple a se join us
 Even if we even if we go for some in cre men tal do ing
 Ah, be ca u se ah, is to be a blue with us that that is it 
So we have a tec hno logy, which tec hni cally wor ks
But it is to tally u nusab le
 And and I 'm cu ri ous, how how far we get in in the se mon ths
So we a re run ning this 
This a re male or this this mo bili zati on So we seek for your help and just talk to any of us 
So may be tho se view who a re al re ady on the se arch team will just ra i se your hand
 So that pe op le se e tho ugh o ne to thre e
 So the yacht so so at le ast for for pe op le in the room al re ady
And if yo u have more of yo u
 If yo u have stu dents who wo uld like to get in to uch with this 
This is a ni ce
It is not sum mer 
Inter nship is like spring, spring in ter nship
 Ple a se, ple a se, let them know, and yo u can read all the de ta ils a bo ut the pro ject in the block
And if yo u want the the real truth, then talk to us  di rec tly
Ye ah, OK than k
Yo u
 Than kYo u all
At some de ta ils yet hun ger
 Well, yo u spo ke a bo ut the the the prob lem from a on this a re
If the re is a mis ta ke in un der stan ding of the of the wor d
and it brings the prob lem  for her to go to the mis si on tran sla ti on, and they also spo ke a bo ut the the mo dule, that puts the pun ctu a ti on into into the ste am of wo e who works  did 
Did yo u con si der some some sink, like the mo on, some sort of Brim mer truck er, or some lan gu a ge mo del 
Let us put it check whet her the sam ple sen ten ces  Okay? a re re ally sen ten ces or dra mati cally good e no ugh to be sent to mac hi ne tran sla ti on was the mos t
So yes, and no this who le pun ctu a ti on in ser ti on  to seg men t
The re is the lan gu a ge mo del as suc h
So that is that is like and Gra ham ba se, but it is not an gra ham
It is it is lon ger se qu en ces
 It is the ne u ral net work ba sed and rang which more tru e
And it is tra i ned on the con ca tena ted sen ten ces 
But I think the se sen ten ces a re con ca tena ted  from or der shuf fled tra i ning set 
So it has this like the sen ten ces came be came ed ges ad ja cent just by ran dom ness, and not by a pro per lo cal con text
 So the re is a cer ta in li mita ti on 
So that is the re is the best part of of that 
So it to tally re li es on some lan gu a ge mo del in the end, the sta tis ti cal  cents more and some gram ma tically," of the sen ten ces in no, no, we a re not con si dering that at all, be ca u se so well, we also do not as su me that pe op le wo uld ot her Gram ma tically Co ur t
Sen ten ces so that is the um the the, prob lem, or that does that yo u may be re fer ring to the wo uld be cal led spe ech  re con struc ti on
And this is so met hing that that o ur De par tment has been wor king on in the boss as well they a re
 The goal is to take the party  dis flu ency spe ech of of myself and con ver ted into a writ ten like this be ach, like pro per all only all good cho ric for gram ma tically pro per, sen ten ces,  but they were not wor king with with this com po nent at all in in o ur system 
So qu i te on the con trary, we a re the re ot her mo ving to wards a mis si on  So this is in pic tu res, the am bi ti on, or the the sum mary of the two tec hno logi es that a re e xami ned bar by o ur pro ject
 tran sla ti on systems, which will be ro bust to tran sla ting even the se a par ti al sen ten ces 
So I have not men ti o ned in the sli des, but a not her of  stu dents of mine do minick
I 'm wat ching is wor king on on mis si on tran sla ti on, which runs not on sen ten ces, but on the win dow all for it is
 So we wo uld like to get rid of the seg men ter al to get her, and new wo ul d
Ho pefully if if we pro vided with rose and good tra i ning data that has this  pro per ty
Then the tran si ti on system wo uld be able to tran sla te this thro ugh an sen ten ces into dis flu ency vin ce 's u sab le in the tar get lan gu a ge,  which care the qu es ti on a bo ut the is su e of whe re to pla ce se e o ur mic rop ho ne, be ca u se se veral ti mes
I saw some spe a kers hol ding the ir mic rop ho ne  on that day cha in, like a nice he avy o ver se as does fre qu ent at all that the
 They cla i ming that it
Is it is yo u? Can? It is gone from the un der stan dab le
And and yo u pre vent flo wing he re
And the re we have not tri ed 
So next next ti me
 Yo u se e me gi ving a talk  a bo ut su rely hol ding mic rop ho ne, much che a per to o ver lo a ded pro perly
I re a lize that the re is no laws be ca u se here in the ro om
 But when yo u put the mic rop ho ne on the arch in your vo i ce has chan ged here in like in the in the loud in the in the wild
 And so I do not know, may be may be the re cor ding has not has not seen any chan ge, but we have OK i
 Ha ve two small qu es ti ons of them 
One
 Qu es ti on con cerns or,  It will fall
 We a re trying to put to put to get her spe ech re cog ni ti on and mac hi ne tran sla ti on into spo ken lan gu a ge tran sla ti on
 it is a re mar k
The re is a thing that if in to nati on is se para te yo u at ten ti on to, and then it might have for the sig nal
And then she got,  of co ur se, in the thro ne spe ec h
Pe op le do not be have
 Accor ding to the ru les that is that is I have o ne qu es ti on for, yo u know, sli de num ber for for tis, or we have to
 I just won der that yet, tho ugh, tho ugh, bet we en low in the 34
In par t
Yo u have kept it does not, but yo u do not have to chan ge
I think this is bo oks
Ok
 So, so we do not know, I do not know if we can ac tu ally give it a try and find a la unch the re is, but whe re whe re is this an t?So
And so he re, ah, and di e in 
So I will I will? I will stop the live sub tit les, be ca u se it is ta king the or a pitch
It had a vi sitor on set 
So I 'm I 'm cu ri ous myself be ca u se here is the pre sent,  be ca u se have o ne more ge neral qu es ti on, yes, so pre cise that if we just go to the pa rag raph yo u in the me an ti me gusts in the thin and the the mo on
 So let us switch of the him D and Hun ga ri an
And and it is o ne and a ze ro
 So this is my English re cog ni zed, and it is be ing tran sla ted into Ger man, and in to check  a so a king up
And and and a more ge neral qu es ti on, which may be
 Yo u have he ard se ven ti mes 
How much can yo u le arn al l?Well, as stu di o, all con si dera ti ons of if yo u all is go ing the of tran sla tors,  in ter pre ters in ter pre ters it, just whe re the is si mul ta ne ous tran sla ti on 
From the stra tegists also say that they a re
 So is this so met hing in the in the system, which wo uld ref lect this things me an, it is not yet
 He re, some his tory of ah, the spe ech re cog ni ti on, but we have not re ally as de par tment
 Not at al l
We a re in to uch with them, be ca u se yo u like it
It helps us
 So we, we think that then we can get hold of the da ta, but the ir in ter pre tati on stra tegi es a re much more a long CA so
 The long ran ge
 So, to say, so, they a re happy to lis ten to co up le of sen ten ces, even for the sum mit in his tran sla ti ons will soon wit hin
 Tho se can still mean 20 se conds af ter that,  and they will first give the who le i de a, and they 
They will spe ak it from Scratch
 And this is very dis tant from what we a re do ing, but we a re a i ming to get into the same bra in 
So to say,  so we have no fo ol, o ur very first data sets whe re we have the so ur ce spe ech in English, which is be ing in ter pre ted live into check ed by some of the se stu dents
 And so we a re also tran scri bing the English
And we a re tran sla ting in the text for m
What was said in English,  and the e volu ti on tool that I men ti o ned that will con si der the qu a lity in terms of full bles sed or si milar sco re for mac hi ne tran sla ti on of the la ke
And the flick er is me ant it is not just that, but it is me ant to be ap pli cab le also to hu man in ter pre ters
 So i de ally, we wo uld se e that the hu man in ter pre ters a re much bet ter in pre cisi on, or the the qu a lity of the o ut put, but they will be much slo wer
 They will have much lon ger lax, and they will al way s
They have no flick ers or bu ri al li kely they wil l
Well, it will be dif fi cult to tran sport, the flick ers, be ca u se the the the way will be col lec ting the data  We have not re ally work on spe ech re cog ni ti on
 so, but wo uld re ally like to have a u toma tic thro ugh that vi o lates both fa cili ti es systems and in ter pre ters in in the same thre e sca les
 And then we se e what all the com pli men tary be nefits of of the se were like gro ups of of pro ces sors
 They stra teg y
So far a re a re not off any u se it to us
 And also the ir e volu ti on stra tegi es a re very dis tan ce from what we a re like tal king a bo ut
 So that that the that we have seen chec klist of when they a re be ing cre a ted the in ter pre ters, and yo u have so me
 So me of the se i tems a re a re to tally ir re levant to o ur tec hno logy
 Ok
Thank yo u
 So I must chan ge
 We have to stop at this po int
     So will I just copy this from from so mew he re
 And it se ems that the only from the e ig hti es pe op le run many sha re tasks and im pro ve the the per for man ce of of the re cog ni ti on
 And here a ro und two to four per cent off word er ror ra te
 That is whe re hu mans a re not with the pre cisi on and on the E
 In e arly days
 In 1990, so met hing some systems got to the hu man per for man ce, and then on con ver sa ti o nal spe ech, which is like un li mited is un li mited spe ech or me e tings pe op le
 The systems a re far from this from this ben chmark, but then has been chan ging, or the last two ye ars thanks to the ne u ral net works
 And I 'm re ally e a ger to know what well what e ver ything can go wrong in life spe ech, so unds sta ti on
 So this i mage more con ver sa ti o nal spe ech, the ben chmark that is 40 for the calls bet we en two ran dom English spe a kers the re
 The hu man le vel of six per cent has been kind of re ac hing two do zen 17
 So that se ems like that spe ech re cog ni ti on
 If it is the right thing
 It can work e qu ally us e qu ally well us as hu mans do
 Then this is the the the his tory of mac hi ne tran sla ti on into check that yo u know, from pre vi ous pre sen ta ti ons off from Mar tin Po pe, well, and also then from me
 This is o ur systems
 And the last o ne is the Su per Hu man mac hi ne tran sla ti on system from English into check into does not 18
 Mar tin spa pe arls set up was able to, yo u know, to o ut per form hu man tran sla tors like pro fes si o nal tran sla tors be lit tles Balk tran sla ti on
 It was they
 So the flo or
 They did not pay more at ten ti on to that, then the then look to the ir nor mal job
 So that was like the the a vera ge pro fes si o nal tran sla ti on qu a lity inch ever lo o ted sen ten ce by sen ten ce
 Uh, the set up by Mar tin Pa pa was was sig ni ficantly bet ter than that
 Obvi ously, the re is many ca ve ats to uh, to uh, take into ac co unt
 But that is the that is the set ting
 Yo u have two tec hno logi es
 Yo u have spo ken English tran sla ti on, which co uld be on par with hu mans, and yo u have mac hi ne tran sla ti on
 Uh
 So, so we have the the spe ech re cog ni ti on, which co uld be on par with the hu mans and mac hi ne tran sla ti on, which co uld be on par with hu mans
 So that is whe re we sa id," let us join them
