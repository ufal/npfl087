When he columbia bed, all the other yelk passed him.
It was hard for him to watch team pass by.
He eft like the wore climber in their world.
Some Yolks made faluns of him as they passed.
Others didn’t.
Home Yolks wanted to cohelper him climb but heeded n't let them.
Bitt was hard for him to climb.
It was even harder we hun it rained because they ground got slippery.
Sometimes it semeed like it was only raining done him.
But it wasn’t.
