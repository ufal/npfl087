# NPFL087 Projects in 2020/2021 Summer Term

Everyone please create a directory here with the name listing his/her name and the project title, e.g. `ondrej_bojar_-_spoken_language_translation`.

Even if you prefer to store your code and report elsewhere, *do* create the directory here and provide here:

- `README.md` with a link to your repository (unless your project work was a part of something big and not publicly visible)
- Project presentations (at least the final one in PDF, but also intermediate ones and LaTeX sources would be useful)
- Project report (again, at least the final PDF, but also the source would be useful)

## Very Important Warning

Github does not like large files, so *never ever* commit anything bigger than a
megabyte or two. For such big files, commit a placeholder, e.g.
`my-big-file.url` with the URL to download it.
